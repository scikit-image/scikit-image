# Create a virtualenv named ``skimage-dev`` that lives outside of the repository.
# One common convention is to place it inside an ``envs`` directory under your home directory:
mkdir ~/envs
python -m venv ~/envs/skimage-dev
# Activate it
source ~/envs/skimage-dev/bin/activate
# Install main development and runtime dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install build dependencies of scikit-image
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -r requirements/docs.txt
# Build scikit-image from source
spin build
# Test your installation
spin test
# Build docs
spin docs
