"""Image Processing SciKit (Toolbox for SciPy)

``scikit-image`` (a.k.a. ``skimage``) is a collection of algorithms for image
processing and computer vision.

The main package of ``skimage`` only provides a few utilities for converting
between image data types; for most features, you need to import one of the
following subpackages:

Subpackages
-----------
color
    Color space conversion.
data
    Test images and example data.
draw
    Drawing primitives (lines, text, etc.) that operate on NumPy arrays.
exposure
    Image intensity adjustment, e.g., histogram equalization, etc.
feature
    Feature detection and extraction, e.g., texture analysis corners, etc.
filters
    Sharpening, edge finding, rank filters, thresholding, etc.
graph
    Graph-theoretic operations, e.g., shortest paths.
io
    Reading, saving, and displaying images and video.
measure
    Measurement of image properties, e.g., similarity and contours.
morphology
    Morphological operations, e.g., opening or skeletonization.
restoration
    Restoration algorithms, e.g., deconvolution algorithms, denoising, etc.
segmentation
    Partitioning an image into multiple regions.
transform
    Geometric and other transforms, e.g., rotation or the Radon transform.
util
    Generic utilities.
viewer
    A simple graphical user interface for visualizing results and exploring
    parameters.

Utility Functions
-----------------
img_as_float
    Convert an image to floating point format, with values in [0, 1].
    Is similar to `img_as_float64`, but will not convert lower-precision
    floating point arrays to `float64`.
img_as_float32
    Convert an image to single-precision (32-bit) floating point format,
    with values in [0, 1].
img_as_float64
    Convert an image to double-precision (64-bit) floating point format,
    with values in [0, 1].
img_as_uint
    Convert an image to unsigned integer format, with values in [0, 65535].
img_as_int
    Convert an image to signed integer format, with values in [-32768, 32767].
img_as_ubyte
    Convert an image to unsigned byte format, with values in [0, 255].
img_as_bool
    Convert an image to boolean format, with values either True or False.
dtype_limits
    Return intensity limits, i.e. (min, max) tuple, of the image's dtype.
