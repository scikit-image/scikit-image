    The image is populated with random shapes with random sizes, random

    Shapes have random (row, col) starting coordinates and random sizes bounded
    by `min_size` and `max_size`. It can occur that a randomly generated shape
    will not fit the image at all. In that case, the algorithm will try again
    with new starting coordinates a certain number of times. However, it also
    means that some shapes may be skipped altogether. In that case, this
    function will generate fewer shapes than requested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : tuple
        The number of rows and columns of the image to generate.
    max_shapes : int
        The maximum number of shapes to (attempt to) fit into the shape.
    min_shapes : int, optional
        The minimum number of shapes to (attempt to) fit into the shape.
    min_size : int, optional
        The minimum dimension of each shape to fit into the image.
    max_size : int, optional
        The maximum dimension of each shape to fit into the image.
    num_channels : int, optional
        Number of channels in the generated image. If 1, generate monochrome
        images, else color images with multiple channels.
    shape : {rectangle, circle, triangle, None} str, optional
        The name of the shape to generate or `None` to pick random ones.
    intensity_range : {tuple of tuples of ints, tuple of ints}, optional
        The range of values to sample pixel values from. For grayscale images
        the format is (min_, max_). For multichannel - ((min_, max_),) if the
        ranges are equal across the channels, and ((min_0, max_0), ... (min_N, max_N))
        if they differ. Maximum range is (0, 255). If None, set to (1, 255) for
        each channel reserving 0-intensity color for background.
    allow_overlap : bool, optional
        If `True`, allow shapes to overlap.
    num_trials : int, optional
        How often to attempt to fit a shape into the image before skipping it.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed to initialize the random number generator.
        If `None`, a random seed from the operating system is used.

    Returns
    -------
    image : uint8 array
        An image with the fitted shapes.
    labels : list
        A list of labels, one per shape in the image. Each label is a
        (category, ((r0, r1), (c0, c1))) tuple specifying the category and
