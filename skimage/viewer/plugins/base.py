    Parameters
    ----------
    image_window : ImageViewer instance.
        Window containing image used in measurement/manipulation.
    useblit : bool
        If True, use blitting to speed up animation. Only available on some
        backends. If None, set to True when using Agg backend, otherwise False.
    figure : :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
        If None, create a figure with a single axes.
    no_toolbar : bool
        If True, figure created by plugin has no toolbar. This has no effect
        on figures passed into `Plugin`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ax : :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
        The parent axes for the widget. Note, if `figure` is passed as a
        parameter, `ax` is set to None since there could be multiple axes
        attached to the figure.
    figure : :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
        The parent figure for the widget.
    canvas : :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase` subclass
        The parent figure canvs for the widget.
    imgview : ImageViewer
        Window containing image used in measurement.
    image : array
        Image used in measurement/manipulation.
    active : bool
        If False, the widget does not respond to events.
