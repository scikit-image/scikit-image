"""watershed.py - watershed algorithm

This module implements a watershed algorithm that apportions pixels into
marked basins. The algorithm uses a priority queue to hold the pixels
with the metric for the priority queue being pixel value, then the time
of entry into the queue - this settles ties in favor of the closest marker.

Some ideas taken from
Soille, "Automated Basin Delineation from Digital Elevation Models Using
Mathematical Morphology", Signal Processing 20 (1990) 171-182.

The most important insight in the paper is that entry time onto the queue
solves two problems: a pixel should be assigned to the neighbor with the
largest gradient or, if there is no gradient, pixels on a plateau should
be split between markers on opposite sides.

def watershed(image, markers, connectivity=None, offset=None, mask=None):
    """
    Return a matrix labeled using the watershed segmentation algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------

    image: ndarray (2-D, 3-D, ...) of integers
        Data array where the lowest value points are labeled first.
    markers: ndarray of the same shape as `image`
        An array marking the basins with the values to be assigned in the
        label matrix. Zero means not a marker. This array should be of an
        integer type.
    connectivity: ndarray, optional
        An array with the same number of dimensions as `image` whose
        non-zero elements indicate neighbors for connection.
        Following the scipy convention, default is a one-connected array of
        the dimension of the image.
    offset: array_like of shape image.ndim, optional
        offset of the connectivity (one offset per dimension)
    mask: ndarray of bools or 0s and 1s, optional
        Array of same shape as `image`. Only points at which mask == True
        will be labeled.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        A labeled matrix of the same type and shape as markers

    See also
    --------

    skimage.segmentation.random_walker: random walker segmentation
        A segmentation algorithm based on anisotropic diffusion, usually
        slower than the watershed but with good results on noisy data and
        boundaries with holes.

    -----
    This function implements a watershed algorithm [1]_that apportions pixels
    into marked basins. The algorithm uses a priority queue to hold the pixels

    Some ideas taken from

    Mathematical Morphology", Signal Processing 20 (1990) 171-182

    The most important insight in the paper is that entry time onto the queue
    solves two problems: a pixel should be assigned to the neighbor with the
    largest gradient or, if there is no gradient, pixels on a plateau should
    be split between markers on opposite sides.

    This implementation converts all arguments to specific, lowest common
    denominator types, then passes these to a C algorithm.

    Markers can be determined manually, or automatically using for example
    the local minima of the gradient of the image, or the local maxima of the
    distance function to the background for separating overlapping objects
    (see example).

    Examples
    --------
    The watershed algorithm is very useful to separate overlapping objects

    >>> # Generate an initial image with two overlapping circles
    >>> x, y = np.indices((80, 80))
    >>> x1, y1, x2, y2 = 28, 28, 44, 52
    >>> r1, r2 = 16, 20
    >>> mask_circle1 = (x - x1)**2 + (y - y1)**2 < r1**2
    >>> mask_circle2 = (x - x2)**2 + (y - y2)**2 < r2**2
    >>> image = np.logical_or(mask_circle1, mask_circle2)
    >>> # Now we want to separate the two objects in image
    >>> # Generate the markers as local maxima of the distance
    >>> # to the background
    >>> from scipy import ndimage
    >>> distance = ndimage.distance_transform_edt(image)
    >>> from skimage.feature import peak_local_max
    >>> local_maxi = peak_local_max(distance, labels=image,
    ...                             footprint=np.ones((3, 3)))
    >>> markers = ndimage.label(local_maxi)[0]
    >>> labels = watershed(-distance, markers, mask=image)

    The algorithm works also for 3-D images, and can be used for example to
    separate overlapping spheres.
