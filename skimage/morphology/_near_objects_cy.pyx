    """Remove objects until a minimal distance is ensured.

    Iterates over all objects (connected pixels that are True) inside an image
    and removes neighboring objects until all remaining ones are at least a
    minimal distance from each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image :
        The raveled view of a n-dimensional array. which is modified inplace.
    labels :
        An array with labels for each object in `image` matching it in shape.
    raveled_indices :
        Indices into `image` and `labels` that determines the iteration order
        and thus which objects take precedence.
    neighbor_offsets :
        A one-dimensional array that contains the offsets to find the
        connected neighbors for any index in `image`.
    kdtree : scipy.spatial.cKDTree
        A KDTree containing the coordinates of all objects in `image`.
    minimal_distance :
        The minimal allowed distance between objects.
    p_norm :
        Which Minkowski p-norm to use to calculate the distance between
        objects. Defaults to 2 which corresponds to the Euclidean distance
        while 1 corresponds to the Manatten distance.
    shape :
        The shape of the unraveled `image`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function and its partner function :func:`~._remove_object` can deal
    with objects where `labels` is 0 inside objects as long as its enclosing
    surface points (in the sense of the neighborhood) are labeled.
    This significantly improves the performance by reducing number of queries
    to the KDTree and its size.
    This effect grows with the size to surface ratio of all evaluated objects.
