    This function returns the same result as greyscale erosion but performs

    Morphological erosion sets a pixel at (i,j) to the minimum over all pixels
    in the neighborhood centered at (i,j). Erosion shrinks bright regions and
    enlarges dark regions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Image array.
    selem : ndarray
        The neighborhood expressed as a 2-D array of 1's and 0's.
    out : ndarray
        The array to store the result of the morphology. If None is
        passed, a new array will be allocated.

    Returns
    -------
    eroded : bool array
        The result of the morphological erosion.

    Morphological dilation sets a pixel at (i,j) to the maximum over all pixels

    and shrinks dark regions.

    Parameters

    This function returns the same result as greyscale opening but performs
    faster for binary images.

    The morphological opening on an image is defined as an erosion followed by
    a dilation. Opening can remove small bright spots (i.e. "salt") and connect
    small dark cracks. This tends to "open" up (dark) gaps between (bright)
    features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Image array.
    selem : ndarray
        The neighborhood expressed as a 2-D array of 1's and 0's.
    out : ndarray

    The morphological closing on an image is defined as a dilation followed by
