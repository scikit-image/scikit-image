    """Return fast binary morphological erosion of an image.

    This function returns the same result as greyscale erosion but performs
    faster for binary images. It is a wrapper to the
    scipy.ndimage.binary_erosion function.

    Morphological erosion sets a pixel at ``(i,j)`` to the minimum over all
    pixels in the neighborhood centered at ``(i,j)``. Erosion shrinks bright
    regions and enlarges dark regions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Binary input image.
    selem : ndarray, optional
        The neighborhood expressed as a 2-D array of 1's and 0's.
        If None, use cross-shaped structuring element (connectivity=1).
    out : ndarray of bool, optional
        The array to store the result of the morphology. If None is
        passed, a new array will be allocated.
    iterations : {int, float}, optional
        The number of times erosion is repeated (defaults to 1). If <1,
        dilation is repeated until the result no longer changes.
    mask : array-like, optional
        If provided, erosion is only performed on elements of `image` with
        a True value at the corresponding `mask` element.
    origin : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Placement of the filter, by default 0.
    border_value : int (cast to 0 or 1), optional
        Value at the border of the output array.

    Returns
    -------
    eroded : ndarray of bool or uint
        The result of the morphological erosion taking values in
        ``[False, True]``.

    This function returns the same result as greyscale opening but performs
    faster for binary images. It is a wrapper for the

    The morphological opening on an image is defined as an erosion followed by
    a dilation. Opening can remove small bright spots (i.e. "salt") and connect
    small dark cracks. This tends to "open" up (dark) gaps between (bright)
    features.

    ----------
