    Start has 8 vertices and is an overlap of square of size `2*a + 1`

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int
        Parameter deciding the size of the star structural element. The side
        of the square array returned is `2*a + 1 + 2*floor(a / 2)`.

        The data type of the footprint.

    Returns

        The footprint where elements of the neighborhood are 1 and 0 otherwise.
