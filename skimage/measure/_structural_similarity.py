                 full=False, **kwargs):
    """Compute the mean structural similarity index between two images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X, Y : ndarray
        Image. Any dimensionality.
    win_size : int or None
        The side-length of the sliding window used in comparison. Must be an
        odd value. If `gaussian_weights` is True, this is ignored and the
        window size will depend on `sigma`.
    gradient : bool, optional
        If True, also return the gradient with respect to Y.
    data_range : float, optional
        The data range of the input image (distance between minimum and
        maximum possible values). By default, this is estimated from the image
        data-type.
    multichannel : bool, optional
        If True, treat the last dimension of the array as channels. Similarity
        calculations are done independently for each channel then averaged.
    gaussian_weights : bool, optional
        If True, each patch has its mean and variance spatially weighted by a
        normalized Gaussian kernel of width sigma=1.5.
    full : bool, optional
        If True, also return the full structural similarity image.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    use_sample_covariance : bool
        If True, normalize covariances by N-1 rather than, N where N is the
        number of pixels within the sliding window.
    K1 : float
        Algorithm parameter, K1 (small constant, see [1]_).
    K2 : float
        Algorithm parameter, K2 (small constant, see [1]_).
    sigma : float
        Standard deviation for the Gaussian when `gaussian_weights` is True.

    Returns
    -------
    mssim : float
        The mean structural similarity over the image.
    grad : ndarray
        The gradient of the structural similarity index between X and Y [2]_.
        This is only returned if `gradient` is set to True.
    S : ndarray
        The full SSIM image.  This is only returned if `full` is set to True.

    Notes
    -----
    To match the implementation of Wang et. al. [1]_, set `gaussian_weights`
    to True, `sigma` to 1.5, and `use_sample_covariance` to False.
