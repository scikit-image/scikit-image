#                 |               |

# array where a the tuple (index, array[index]) represents an edge,
# so for our example, array[2] == 1, array[7] == 6 and array[1] == 1, because
# 1 is the root.
# Last but not least, one array can hold more than one tree as long as their
# indices are different. It is the case in this algorithm, so for that reason
# the array is referred to as the "forest" = multiple trees next to each
# other.
#
# In this algorithm, there are as many indices as there are elements in the
# array to label and array[x] == x for all x. As the labelling progresses,
# equivalence between so-called provisional (i.e. not final) labels is
# discovered and trees begin to surface.
# When we found out that label 5 and 3 are the same, we assign array[5] = 3.
