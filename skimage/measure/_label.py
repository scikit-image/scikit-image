def label(input, neighbors=None, background=None, return_num=False,
          connectivity=None):
    r"""Label connected regions of an integer array.

    Two pixels are connected when they are neighbors and have the same value.
    In 2D, they can be neighbors either in a 1- or 2-connected sense.
    The value refers to the maximum number of orthogonal hops to consider a
    pixel/voxel a neighbor::

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : ndarray of dtype int
        Image to label.
    neighbors : {4, 8}, int, optional
        Whether to use 4- or 8-"connectivity".
        In 3D, 4-"connectivity" means connected pixels have to share face,
        whereas with 8-"connectivity", they have to share only edge or vertex.
        **Deprecated, use** ``connectivity`` **instead.**
    background : int, optional
        Consider all pixels with this value as background pixels, and label
        them as 0. By default, 0-valued pixels are considered as background
        pixels.
    return_num : bool, optional
        Whether to return the number of assigned labels.
    connectivity : int, optional
        Maximum number of orthogonal hops to consider a pixel/voxel
        as a neighbor.
        Accepted values are ranging from  1 to input.ndim. If ``None``, a full
        connectivity of ``input.ndim`` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    labels : ndarray of dtype int
        Labeled array, where all connected regions are assigned the
        same integer value.
    num : int, optional
        Number of labels, which equals the maximum label index and is only
        returned if return_num is `True`.
