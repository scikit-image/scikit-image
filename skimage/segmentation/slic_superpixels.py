    """Segments image using k-means clustering in Color-(x,y) space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : (width, height [, depth] [, 3]) ndarray
        Input image, which can be 2D or 3D, and grayscale or multi-channel
        (see `multichannel` parameter).
    n_segments : int, optional (default: 100)
        The (approximate) number of labels in the segmented output image.
    compactness: float, optional (default: 10)
        Balances color-space proximity and image-space proximity. Higher
        values give more weight to image-space. As `compactness` tends to
        infinity, superpixel shapes become square/cubic.
    max_iter : int, optional (default: 10)
        Maximum number of iterations of k-means.
    sigma : float, optional (default: 1)
        Width of Gaussian smoothing kernel for preprocessing. Zero means no
        smoothing.
    multichannel : bool, optional (default: None)
        Whether the last axis of the image is to be interpreted as multiple
        channels. Only 3 channels are supported. If `None`, the function will
        attempt to guess this, and raise a warning if ambiguous, when the
        array has shape (M, N, 3).
    convert2lab : bool, optional (default: True)
        Whether the input should be converted to Lab colorspace prior to
        segmentation.  For this purpose, the input is assumed to be RGB. Highly
        recommended.
    ratio : float, optional
        Synonym for `compactness`. This keyword is deprecated.

    Returns
    -------
    segment_mask : (width, height) ndarray
        Integer mask indicating segment labels.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If:
            - the image dimension is not 2 or 3 and `multichannel == False`, OR
            - the image dimension is not 3 or 4 and `multichannel == True`, OR
            - `multichannel == True` and the length of the last dimension of
            the image is not 3, OR

    Notes
    -----
    If `sigma > 0` as is default, the image is smoothed using a Gaussian kernel
    prior to segmentation.

    The image is rescaled to be in [0, 1] prior to processing.

    Images of shape (M, N, 3) are interpreted as 2D RGB images by default. To
    interpret them as 3D with the last dimension having length 3, use
    `multichannel=False`.
