    Parameters
    ----------
    keypoints1 : (M, 2) ndarray
        M Keypoints from the first image described using skimage.feature.brief
    descriptors1 : (M, P) ndarray
        Binary descriptors of size P about M keypoints in the first image.
    keypoints2 : (N, 2) ndarray
        N Keypoints from the second image described using skimage.feature.brief
    descriptors2 : (N, P) ndarray
        Binary descriptors of size P about N keypoints in the second image.
    threshold : float in range [0, 1]
        Maximum allowable hamming distance between descriptors of two keypoints
        in separate images to be regarded as a match.
    cross_check : bool
        If True, the matched keypoints are returned after cross checking i.e. a
        matched pair (keypoint1, keypoint2) is returned iff keypoint2 is the best
        match for keypoint1 in second image and keypoint1 is the best match for
        keypoint2 in first image.

    Returns
    -------
    matches : (Q, 2, 2) ndarray
        Location of Q matched keypoint pairs from two images.
    mask1 : (Q,) ndarray
        Indices of keypoints in keypoints1 that have been matched.
    mask2 : (Q,) ndarray
        Indices of keypoints in keypoints2 that have been matched.
