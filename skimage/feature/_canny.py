    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array
        Image you want to smooth.
    function : callable
        A function that does image smoothing.
    mask : array
        Mask with 1's for significant pixels, 0's for masked pixels.

    Notes
    ------
    This function calculates the fractional contribution of masked pixels
    by applying the function to the mask (which gets you the fraction of
    the pixel data that's due to significant points). We then mask the image
    and apply the function. The resulting values will be lower by the
    bleed-over fraction, so you can recalibrate by dividing by the function
    on the mask to recover the effect of smoothing from just the significant
    pixels.

    """Edge filter an image using the Canny algorithm.

    Parameters
    -----------
    image : 2D array
        Grayscale input image to detect edges on; can be of any dtype.
    sigma : float, optional
        Standard deviation of the Gaussian filter.
    low_threshold : float, optional
        Lower bound for hysteresis thresholding (linking edges).
        If None, low_threshold is set to 10% of dtype's max.
    high_threshold : float, optional
        Upper bound for hysteresis thresholding (linking edges).
        If None, high_threshold is set to 20% of dtype's max.
    mask : array, dtype=bool, optional
        Mask to limit the application of Canny to a certain area.
    use_quantiles : bool, optional
        If True then treat low_threshold and high_threshold as quantiles of the
        edge magnitude image, rather than absolute edge magnitude values. If True
        then the thresholds must be in the range [0, 1].

    Returns
    -------
    output : 2D array (image)
        The binary edge map.

    skimage.sobel

    Notes
    -----
    The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

    * Smooth the image using a Gaussian with ``sigma`` width.

    * Apply the horizontal and vertical Sobel operators to get the gradients
      within the image. The edge strength is the norm of the gradient.

    * Thin potential edges to 1-pixel wide curves. First, find the normal
      to the edge at each point. This is done by looking at the
      signs and the relative magnitude of the X-Sobel and Y-Sobel
      to sort the points into 4 categories: horizontal, vertical,
      diagonal and antidiagonal. Then look in the normal and reverse
      directions to see if the values in either of those directions are
      greater than the point in question. Use interpolation to get a mix of
      points instead of picking the one that's the closest to the normal.

    * Perform a hysteresis thresholding: first label all points above the
      high threshold as edges. Then recursively label any point above the
      low threshold that is 8-connected to a labeled point as an edge.

    # The steps involved:
    #
    # * Smooth using the Gaussian with sigma above.
    #
    # * Apply the horizontal and vertical Sobel operators to get the gradients
    #   within the image. The edge strength is the sum of the magnitudes
    #   of the gradients in each direction.
    #
    # * Find the normal to the edge at each point using the arctangent of the
    #   ratio of the Y sobel over the X sobel - pragmatically, we can
    #   look at the signs of X and Y and the relative magnitude of X vs Y
    #   to sort the points into 4 categories: horizontal, vertical,
    #   diagonal and antidiagonal.
    #
    # * Look in the normal and reverse directions to see if the values
    #   in either of those directions are greater than the point in question.

    #
    # Regarding masks, any point touching a masked point will have a gradient
    # that is "infected" by the masked point, so it's enough to erode the
    # mask by one and then mask the output. We also mask out the border points
    # because who knows what lies beyond the edge of the image?
