cdef class MCP:
    """MCP(costs, offsets=None, fully_connected=True, sampling=None)

    A class for finding the minimum cost path through a given n-d costs array.

    Given an n-d costs array, this class can be used to find the minimum-cost
    path through that array from any set of points to any other set of points.
    Basic usage is to initialize the class and call find_costs() with a one
    or more starting indices (and an optional list of end indices). After
    that, call traceback() one or more times to find the path from any given
    end-position to the closest starting index. New paths through the same
    costs array can be found by calling find_costs() repeatedly.

    The cost of a path is calculated simply as the sum of the values of the
    `costs` array at each point on the path. The class MCP_Geometric, on the
    other hand, accounts for the fact that diagonal vs. axial moves are of
    different lengths, and weights the path cost accordingly.

    Array elements with infinite or negative costs will simply be ignored, as
    will paths whose cumulative cost overflows to infinite.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : ndarray
    offsets : iterable, optional
        A list of offset tuples: each offset specifies a valid move from a
        given n-d position.
        If not provided, offsets corresponding to a singly- or fully-connected
        n-d neighborhood will be constructed with make_offsets(), using the
        `fully_connected` parameter value.
    fully_connected : bool, optional
        If no `offsets` are provided, this determines the connectivity of the
        generated neighborhood. If true, the path may go along diagonals
        between elements of the `costs` array; otherwise only axial moves are
        permitted.
    sampling : tuple, optional
        For each dimension, specifies the distance between two cells/voxels.
        If not given or None, the distance is assumed unit.

    Attributes
    ----------
    offsets : ndarray
        Equivalent to the `offsets` provided to the constructor, or if none
        were so provided, the offsets created for the requested n-d
        neighborhood. These are useful for interpreting the `traceback` array
        returned by the find_costs() method.

    Find distance-weighted minimum cost paths through an n-d costs array.

    See the documentation for MCP for full details. This class differs from
    MCP in that the cost of a path is not simply the sum of the costs along
    that path.

    This class instead assumes that the costs array contains at each position
    the "cost" of a unit distance of travel through that position. For
    example, a move (in 2-d) from (1, 1) to (1, 2) is assumed to originate in
    the center of the pixel (1, 1) and terminate in the center of (1, 2). The
    entire move is of distance 1, half through (1, 1) and half through (1, 2);
    thus the cost of that move is `(1/2)*costs[1,1] + (1/2)*costs[1,2]`.

    On the other hand, a move from (1, 1) to (2, 2) is along the diagonal and
    is sqrt(2) in length. Half of this move is within the pixel (1, 1) and the
    other half in (2, 2), so the cost of this move is calculated as
    `(sqrt(2)/2)*costs[1,1] + (sqrt(2)/2)*costs[2,2]`.

    These calculations don't make a lot of sense with offsets of magnitude
    greater than 1. Use the `sampling` argument in order to deal with
    anisotropic data.
