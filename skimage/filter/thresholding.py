    """Applies an adaptive threshold to an array.

    Also known as local or dynamic thresholding where the threshold value is
    the weighted mean for the local neighborhood of a pixel subtracted by a
    constant. Alternatively the threshold can be determined dynamically by a a
    given function using the 'generic' method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : (N, M) ndarray
        Input image.
    block_size : int
        Uneven size of pixel neighborhood which is used to calculate the
        threshold value (e.g. 3, 5, 7, ..., 21, ...).
    method : {'generic', 'gaussian', 'mean', 'median'}, optional
        Method used to determine adaptive threshold for local neighbourhood in
        weighted mean image.

        * 'generic': use custom function (see `param` parameter)
        * 'gaussian': apply gaussian filter (see `param` parameter for custom\
                      sigma value)
        * 'mean': apply arithmetic mean filter
        * 'median': apply median rank filter

        By default the 'gaussian' method is used.
    offset : float, optional
        Constant subtracted from weighted mean of neighborhood to calculate
        the local threshold value. Default offset is 0.
    mode : {'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'}, optional
        The mode parameter determines how the array borders are handled, where
        cval is the value when mode is equal to 'constant'.
        Default is 'reflect'.
    param : {int, function}, optional
        Either specify sigma for 'gaussian' method or function object for
        'generic' method. This functions takes the flat array of local
        neighbourhood as a single argument and returns the calculated
        threshold for the centre pixel.

    threshold : (N, M) ndarray

def threshold_isodata(image, nbins=256, return_all=False):

    Histogram-based threshold, known as Ridler-Calvard method or inter-means.
    Threshold values returned satisfy the following equality:
    threshold = (image[image <= threshold].mean() +
                 image[image > threshold].mean()) / 2.0
    That is, returned thresholds are intensities that separate the image into
    two groups of pixels, where the threshold intensity is midway between the
    mean intensities of these groups.

    For integer images, the above equality holds to within one; for floating-
    point images, the equality holds to within the histogram bin-width.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array
        Input image.
    nbins : int, optional
        Number of bins used to calculate histogram. This value is ignored for
        integer arrays.
    return_all: bool, optional
        If False (default), return only the lowest threshold that satisfies
        the above equality. If True, return all valid thresholds.
