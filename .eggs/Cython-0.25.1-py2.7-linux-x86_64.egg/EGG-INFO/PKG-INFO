Description: The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
        easy as Python itself.  Cython is a source code translator based on Pyrex_,
        but supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.
        
        The Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python
        code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional
        static typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and
        declare fast C types on variables and class attributes.  This allows the
        compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.
        
        This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external
        C/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of
        Python code.
        
        Note that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms that are not
        covered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI, it is substantially faster
        than a full source build to install an uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with::
        
            pip install Cython --install-option="--no-cython-compile"
