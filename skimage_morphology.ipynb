      "Morphological image processing is a collection of non-linear operations related to the shape or morphology of features in an image, such as boundaries, skeletons, etc. Morphological operations rely only on the relative ordering of pixel values, not on their numerical values, and therefore are especially suited to the processing of binary images. It is based on set theory and makes use of logical operations to carry out the functionality and hence are less computationally intensive and easy to implement. In any given technique, we probe an image with a small shape or template called a structuring element. The structuring element is positioned at all possible locations in the image and it is compared with the corresponding neighbourhood of pixels. Neighborhood of a pixel is defined as all the pixels with a value 1 in the structuring element.\n",
