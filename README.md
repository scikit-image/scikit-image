## Installation from source

Install dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, install scikit-image using:

```
$ pip install .
```

If you plan to develop the package, you may run it directly from source:

```
$ pip install -e .  # Do this once to add package to Python path
```

Every time you modify Cython files, also run:

```
$ python setup.py build_ext -i  # Build binary extensions
```
