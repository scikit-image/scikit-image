=======
The repository has moved!
=========================

Please note that, due to the package rename (which helps us to provide
namespace clashes), ``scikits-image`` is now located at

`https://github.com/scikits-image/scikits-image
<https://github.com/scikits-image/scikits-image>`__.

We apologise for the inconvenience; hopefully this is the last time we move!
