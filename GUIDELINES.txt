Guidelines and Coding Conventions
=================================

Import
------

The following import conventions are used throughout the NumPy source
and documentation::

   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib as mpl
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Do not abbreviate ``scipy``. There is no motivating use case to
abbreviate it in the real world, so we avoid it in the documentation
to avoid confusion.

In our examples, we import the ``data`` submodule instead of its function,
such that the image can be changed easily::

    from skimage import data

    img = data.coins()


Arguments
---------

* `image`: input image as numpy ndarray.


Keyword arguments
-----------------

* `multichannel` (default: ): Whether the last axis of the image is to be
interpreted as multiple channels. See #4294 for `multichannel` vs `channel_axis`.
See #2613 for default value.
* `selem`, `structure`, `footprint`: The neighborhood expressed as an array of 1's and 0's. See #4154
* `in_place`, `out` (default: ) See #4563
* `max_iter`, `max_iterations`, `iterations`, `n_iter_max`, `niter`: Maximum number of iterations. See #4154
* `tol`: Tolerance
* `copy`, `force_copy`
* `method`
* `mode`



Spelling
--------

For consistency, we choose to use American English spelling:

* color (instead of colour)
* gray (instead of grey)
