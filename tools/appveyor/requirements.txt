# Fetch numpy and scipy wheels from the sklearn rackspace wheelhouse.
# Those wheels were generated by @ogrisel by calling `wheel convert` on
# the binaries from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
# This is a temporary solution. As soon as numpy, scipy and cython provide
# official wheels for windows we can delete this --find-links line.

# fix the versions of binary packages to force the use of the whl

# wheels are preferred for a given version
