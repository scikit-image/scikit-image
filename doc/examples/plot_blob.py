Blob Detection
==============

Blobs are bright on dark or dark on bright regions in an image. In
this example, blobs are detected using 3 algorithms. The image used
in this case is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field. Each bright dot in the
image is a star or a galaxy.

Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
-----------------------------
This is the most accurate and slowest approach. It computes the Laplacian
of Gaussian images with successively increasing standard deviation and
stacks them up in a cube. Blobs are local maximas in this cube. Detecting
larger blobs is especially slower because of larger kernel sizes during
convolution. Only bright blobs on dark backgrounds are detected. See
:py:meth:`skimage.feature.blob_log` for usage.

Difference of Gaussian (DoG)
----------------------------
This is a faster approximation of LoG approach. In this case the image is
blurred with increasing standard deviations and the difference between
two successively blurred images are stacked up in a cube. This method
suffers from the same disadvantage as LoG approach for detecting larger
blobs. Blobs are again assumed to be bright on dark. See
:py:meth:`skimage.feature.blob_dog` for usage.

Hessian-Laplace
----------------------------
This is the fastest approach. It detects blobs by finding maximas in the
matrix of the Determinant of Hessian of the image for each scale and
then by leaving the blobs that are local maximas in the scale space
of Laplacian of Gaussian of the same image. The detection speed is
independent of the size of blobs as internally the implementation uses
box filters instead of convolutions. Blobs are again assumed to be bright on dark
The downside is that small blobs (<3px) are not detected accurately. 
See :py:meth:`skimage.feature.blob_doh_log` for usage. Determinant of Hessian 
for scale selection has significantly better repeatability properties under 
affine or perspective image transformations than the Laplacian. 
This is important if descriptors are later applied to these points and 
matching algoritms are used to find similar points on different images 
of the same scene. This blob detection method is, therefore, 
worse than Determinant of Hessian blob detection method.

Determinant of Hessian (DoH)
----------------------------
This is the fastest approach. It detects blobs by finding maximas in the
matrix of the Determinant of Hessian of the image. The detection speed is
independent of the size of blobs as internally the implementation uses
box filters instead of convolutions. Bright on dark as well as dark on
bright blobs are detected. The downside is that small blobs (<3px) are not
detected accurately. See :py:meth:`skimage.feature.blob_doh` for usage.
