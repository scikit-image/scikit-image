Colocalization metrics
======================

In this example, we demonstrate the use of different metrics to assess the
colocalization of two different image channels.

Colocalization can be split into two different concepts:
1. Co-occurence: What proportion of a substance is localized to a particular
area?
2. Correlation: What is the relationship in intensity between two substances?

# Co-occurence: subcellular localization
# ======================================
#
# Imagine that we are trying to determine the subcellular localization of a
# protein - is it located more in the nucleus or cytoplasm compared to a
# control?
#
# We begin by segmenting the nucleus of a sample image as described in another
# `example <https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_fluorescence_nuclear_envelope.html>`_
# and assume that whatever is not in the nucleus is in the cytoplasm.
# The protein, "protein A", will be simulated as blobs and segmented.

# Intersection coefficient
# ========================
#
# After segmenting both the nucleus and the protein of interest, we can
# determine what fraction of the protein A segmentation overlaps with the
# nucleus segmentation.

#####################################################################
# Manders' Colocalization Coefficient (MCC)
# =========================================
#
# The overlap coefficient assumes that the area of protein segmentation
# corresponds to the concentration of that protein - with larger areas
# indicating more protein. As the resolution of images are usually too small to
# make out individual proteins, they can clump together within one pixel,
# making the intensity of that pixel brighter. So, to better capture the
# protein concentration, we may choose to determine what proportion of the
# *intensity* of the protein channel is inside the nucleus. This metric is
# known as Manders' Colocalization Coefficient.
#
# In this image, while there are a lot of protein A spots within the nucleus
# they are dim compared to some of the spots outside the nucleus, so the MCC is
# much lower than the overlap coefficient.

measure.manders_coloc_coeff(proteinA, nucleus_seg)

#####################################################################
# After choosing a co-occurence metric, we can apply the same process to
# control images. If no control images are available, the Costes method could
# be used to compare the MCC value of the original image with that of the
# randomly scrambled image. Information about this method is given in [1]_.

# Correlation: association of two proteins
# ========================================

# every pixel to see the relationship between them.

# correlation coefficient like `Spearman's
# <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html>`_
