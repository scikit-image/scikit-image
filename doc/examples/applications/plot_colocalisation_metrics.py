Colocalization metrics
===========

In this example, we demonstrate the use of different metrics to assess the
colocalisation of two different image channels.

Colocalisation can be split into two different concepts:
1. Co-occurence: what proportion of a substance is localised to a particular area
2. Correlation: what is the relationship in intensity between two substances

# Co-occurence: subcellular localization
# ==========================
# Imagine that we are trying to determine the subcellular localization of a
# protein - is it located more in the nucleus or cytoplasm compared to a
# control?

# We begin by segmenting the nucleus of a sample image as described in another
# `example <https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_fluorescence_nuclear_envelope.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-fluorescence-nuclear-envelope-py>`_
#  and assume that whatever is not in the nucleus is in the cytoplasm.
#  The protein, "Protein A", will be simulated as blobs and segmented.

# **Intersection coefficient**
# After segmenting both the nucleus and the protein of interest, we can
# determine what fraction of the protein A segmentation overlaps with the
# nucleus segmentation.

#####################################################################
# **Mander's Colocalisation Coefficient (MCC)
# The overlap coefficient assumes that the area of protein segmentation
# corresponds to the concentration of that protein - with larger areas
# indicating more protein. As the resolution of images are usually too small to
# make out individual proteins, they can clump together within one pixel, making
# the intensity of that pixel brighter. So to better capture the the protein
# concentration, we may choose to determine what proportion of the *intensity*
# of the protein channel is inside the nucleus. This metric is known as Manders'
# Colocalisation Coefficient.
#
# In this image, while there are a lot of Protein A spots within the nucleus
# they are dim compared to some of the spots outside the nucleus, so the MCC is
# much lower than the overlap coefficient.

measure.manders_coloc_coeff(proteinA, nucleus_seg)

# After choosing a co-occurence metric, we can apply the same process to control
# images. If no control images are available, the Costes method could be used to
# compare the MCC value of the original image with that of the randomly
# scrambled image. Information about this method is given in [1]_.

# Correlation: association of two proteins
# ==========================

# generating protein B data that is correlated to protein A for demo
