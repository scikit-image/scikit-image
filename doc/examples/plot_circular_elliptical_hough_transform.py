Circular and Elliptical Hough Transforms
========================================

The Hough transform in its simplest form is a `method to detect
straight lines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform>`__
but it can also be used to detect circles or ellipses.
The algorithm assumes that the edge is detected and it is robust against
noise or missing points.

Circle detection
================

In the following example, the Hough transform is used to detect
coin positions and match their edges. We provide a range of
plausible radii. For each radius, two circles are extracted and
we finally keep the five most prominent candidates.
The result shows that coin positions are well-detected.


Algorithm overview
------------------

Given a black circle on a white background, we first guess its
radius (or a range of radii) to construct a new circle.
This circle is applied on each black pixel of the original picture
and the coordinates of this circle are voting in an accumulator.
From this geometrical construction, the original circle center
position receives the highest score.

Note that the accumulator size is built to be larger than the
original picture in order to detect centers outside the frame.
Its size is extended by two times the larger radius.

Ellipse detection
=================

In this second example, the aim is to detect the edge of a coffee cup.
Basically, this is a projection of a circle, i.e. an ellipse.
The problem to solve is much more difficult because five parameters have to be
determined, instead of three for circles.


Algorithm overview
------------------

The algorithm takes two different points belonging to the ellipse. It assumes
that it is the main axis. A loop on all the other points determines how much
an ellipse passes to them. A good match corresponds to high accumulator values.

A full description of the algorithm can be found in reference [1]_.
