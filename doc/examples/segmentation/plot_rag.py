Region Adjacency Graphs
=======================

This example demonstrates the use of the `merge_nodes` function of a Region
Adjacency Graph (RAG). The `RAG` class represents a undirected weighted graph
which inherits from `networkx.graph` class. When a new node is formed by
merging two nodes, the edge weight of all the edges incident on the resulting
node can be updated by a user defined function `weight_func`.

The default behaviour is to use the smaller edge weight in case of a conflict.
The example below also shows how to use a custom function to select the larger
weight instead.

    Returns a dictionary with `"weight"` set as either the weight between

    Parameters
    ----------

    src, dst : int
        The vertices in `g` to be merged.
    n : int

    -------
    data : dict
        A dict with the "weight" attribute set the weight between
        (`src`, `n`) or (`dst`, `n`) in `g` or the maximum of the two when
