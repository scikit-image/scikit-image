# We illustrate how to apply one of these thresholding algorithms.
# Otsu's method [2]_ calculates an "optimal" threshold (marked by a red line in the
# histogram below) by maximizing the variance between two classes of pixels,
# which are separated by the threshold. Equivalently, this threshold minimizes
# the intra-class variance.
