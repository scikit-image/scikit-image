FastDRaW segmentation
=====================

The FastDRaW algorithm [1]_ is based on the Random Walker (RW) algorithm [2]_
to perform fast image segmentation using a set of pixels labeled as belonging
to different objects (e.g., foreground and background labels). The
computational bottleneck for RW is solving a linear system whose size increases
with the image size. To reduce the computation time, the FastDRaW algorithm
relies on a coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, performed in two steps:
First, on a low-resolution version of the image, a coarse RW segmentation is
computed over a restricted region of interest (ROI). Second, the result is
refined by applying the RW algorithm at full resolution over a narrow strip
around the coarse contour.

Note: Where RW computes the probabilities of pixels belonging to each label
category, FastDRaW computes the probabilities of pixels belonging to a target
label category. For example, if the image contains labels [1, 2, 3] and the
target label is 1, then, both labels 2 and 3 are considered outside the object,
when label 1 is considered as belonging to the object.

Pros:
- FastDRaW allows a major gain in computation time
- Implicit labeling of pixels lying outside the ROI as not belonging to the
  target label category, which reduces the required amount of labels to
  acheive the segmentation
Cons:
- The sum of probabilities of each label category is no longer ensured to be
  equal to 1. This is due to the target label strategy which forces the pixels
  outside the ROI to have zero probability belonging to the target label.

In this example, we create an interactive window to compare between RW and
FastDRaW segmetnations in the case of two label categories (foreground and
background). The user labels the original image (at left) using the mouse:
left click for foreground and right click for background. Then, using "space
bar" to run both segmentation. The computation time is displayed.
