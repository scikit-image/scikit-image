Niblack, Sauvola and Phansalkar Thresholding
============================================

Niblack, Sauvola and Phansalkar thresholds are local thresholding techniques
that are useful for images where the background is not uniform. Niblack and
Sauvola thresholds are especially usefull for text recognition [1]_, [2]_,
while the Phansalkar threshold was originally designed for detection of cell
nuclei in low contrast images [3]_. Instead of calculating a single global
threshold for the entire image, several thresholds are calculated for every
pixel by using specific formulae that take into account the mean and standard
deviation of the local neighborhood (defined by a window centered around the
pixel).

Here, we binarize an image using these algorithms compare it to a common global
thresholding technique. Parameter `window_size` determines the size of the
window that contains the surrounding pixels.
