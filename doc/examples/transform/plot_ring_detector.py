Ridge Directed Ring Detection
=============================

Robust and highly performant ring detection algorithm for 3D particle
tracking using 2D microscopy imaging.

Hereâ€™s a quick description of the parameters. The explanations refer to
the terms as introduced in `Afik 2015`_ and its Supplementary
Information.

``sigma`` is the width of the Gaussian Kernel to smooth the image; a
typical good value should be the width (measured in pixels) of the ridge
you would like to detect (to clarify, this is not the radius of the ring
but the thickness of the curve).

``ksize`` is the size of the `Sobel kernel`_ to estimate the image
spatial derivatives (the default should work in most cases)

``curv_thresh`` this sets a threshold for preliminary search for ridges;
pixels of least `principal curvature`_ (the smaller value of the two
eigenvalues of the `Hessian`_ applied to the image) *larger* than
``curv_thresh`` would not be considered. This can be used to spare
unnecessary calculations (speed-up) and avoid ridges which are too flat
( reduce noise). `Fig. 2b`_ shows the output which is affected by
``sigma``, ``ksize`` and ``curv_thresh``.

``Rmin`` smallest radius to consider in the search for circles (measured
in pixels)

``Rmax`` largest radius to consider in the search for circles (measured
in pixels)

``vote_thresh`` this sets a threshold for preliminary search for circle
candidates in the parameter (Hough) space; see `Fig. 2c`_. Elements with
vote count *smaller* than ``vote_thresh`` would not be examined. This
can be used to spare unnecessary calculations (speed-up).

``circle_thresh`` this sets a threshold to filter detected circle
candidates; ideally one would expect a circle to have 2 \* pi \* ``r``
votes per circle of radius ``r``; given image quality and the
optimisation of the parameters applied in earlier stages, one may like
to be satisfied with a fraction of a circle. ``circle_thresh`` should be
a value between 0 and 2*pi; note that the radius ``r`` should not be
included; e.g. for 50% of the circumference one should set
``circle_thresh = pi`` (for ``pi = np.pi`` or roughly ``3.14``). Circle
candidates with vote count smaller than ``circle_thresh`` would be
discarded. See `Figure 2d`_.

``dr`` as part of sub-pixel evaluation, a best fit is being applied to
the detected ridges. To include ridge pixels which are expected to
belong to the candidate circle, an annulus mask of thickness ``dr``
(measured in pixels) is created, based on the circle parameters found in
earlier stages in the algorithm. See the example in `Fig. 2e`_.

``eccentricity`` if ``eccentricity`` is non-zero, a fit to ellipse will
be applied, instead of a circle; this is far from optimal.
