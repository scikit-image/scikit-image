Build image pyramids
====================

The ``pyramid_gaussian`` function takes an image and yields successive images
shrunk by a constant scale factor. Image pyramids are often used, e.g., to
implement algorithms for denoising, texture discrimination, and scale-invariant
detection.

# Generate a composite image for visualization
# ============================================
#
# For visualization, we generate a composite image with the same number of rows
# as the source image but with ``cols + pyramid[1].shape[1]`` columns. We then
# have space to stack all of the dowsampled images to the right of the
# original.
#
# Note: The sum of the number of rows in all dowsampled images in the pyramid
# may sometimes exceed the original image size in cases when image.shape[0] is
# not a power of two. We expand the number of rows in the composite slightly as
# necessary to account for this. Expansion beyond the number of rows in the
# original will also be necessary to cover cases where downscale < 2.

# determine the total number of rows and columns for the composite
composite_rows = max(rows, sum(p.shape[0] for p in pyramid[1:]))
composite_cols = cols + pyramid[1].shape[1]
composite_image = np.zeros((composite_rows, composite_cols, 3),
                           dtype=np.double)

# store the original to the left
composite_image[:rows, :cols, :] = pyramid[0]

# stack all downsampled images in a column to the right of the original
i_row = 0

    n_rows, n_cols = p.shape[:2]

    i_row += n_rows
