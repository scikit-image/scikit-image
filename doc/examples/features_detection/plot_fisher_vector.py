===============================
Fisher vector feature encoding
===============================

A Fisher vector is an image feature encoding and quantization technique that
can be seen as a soft or probabilistic version of the popular
bag-of-visual-words or VLAD algorithms. Images are modelled using a visual
vocabulary which is estimated using a K-mode Gaussian mixture model trained on
low-level image features such as SIFT or ORB descriptors. The Fisher vector
itself is a concatenation of the gradients of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
with respect to its parameters - mixture weights, means, and covariance
matrices.

In this example, we compute Fisher vectors for the digits dataset in
scikit-learn, and train a classifier on these representations.

Please note that scikit-learn is required to run this example.
