========================
Sliding window histogram
========================

Histogram matching can be used for object detection in images [1]_. This
example extracts a single coin from the ``skimage.data.coins`` image and uses
histogram matching to attempt to locate it within the original image.

First, a box-shaped region of the image containing the target coin is
extracted and a histogram of its greyscale values is computed.

Next, for each pixel in the test image, a histogram of the greyscale values in
a region of the image surrounding the pixel is computed.
``skimage.filters.rank.windowed_histogram`` is used for this task, as it employs
an efficient sliding window based algorithm that is able to compute these
histograms quickly [2]_. The local histogram for the region surrounding each
pixel in the image is compared to that of the single coin, with a similarity
measure being computed and displayed.

The histogram of the single coin is computed using ``numpy.histogram`` on a box
shaped region surrounding the coin, while the sliding window histograms are
computed using a disc shaped structural element of a slightly different size.
This is done in aid of demonstrating that the technique still finds similarity
in spite of these differences.

To demonstrate the rotational invariance of the technique, the same test is
performed on a version of the coins image rotated by 45 degrees.
