Haar-like feature descriptor
============================

Haar-like features are simple digital image features that were introduced in a
real-time face detector [1]_. These features can be efficiently computed on any
scale in constant time, using an integral image [1]_. After that, a small
number of critical features is selected from this large set of potential
features (e.g., using AdaBoost learning algorithm as in [1]_). The following
example will show the mechanism to build this family of descriptors.
