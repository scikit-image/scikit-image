===================================
Separate self-overlapping polygons
===================================

This example shows how to separate a self-overlapping polygon into non
self-overlapping sub-polygons using the method proposed in [1]_.
Each sub-polygon can then be drawn or analyzed separately.

A self-overlapping polygon is a surface enclosed by a curve in a way that only
one face of such surface points upwards. That polygon can self-intersect but
not twist the surface. An example of a self-overlapping polygon is the loop
formed by an exit ramp on a highway. The road overlaps, but does not twist in
any segment. Conversely, a folded sheet of paper is self-intersecting but not
self-overlapping, since two faces of the paper end pointing upwards.
