Announcement: scikit-image 0.X.0
================================

We're happy to announce the release of scikit-image v0.X.0!

scikit-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy that includes algorithms
for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation,
analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.

New Features
------------

- A new function ``segmentation.expand_labels`` has been added in order to dilate
  labels while preventing overlap (#4795)
- It is now possible to pass extra measurement functions to
  ``measure.regionprops`` and ``regionprops_table`` (#4810)
- Added a new perimeter function - ``measure.perimeter_crofton``.
- Added 3D support for many filters in skimage.filters.rank.
- New images have been added in the ``data`` subpackage: ``data.eagle``
  (#4922), TODO for other images 
  Also note that the image for ``data.camera`` has been changed due to
  copyright issues (#4913).


Documentation
-------------

- A new doc tutorial presenting a cell biology example has been added to the
  gallery (#4648). The scientific content benefited from a much appreciated
  review by Pierre Poulain and Fred Bernard, both assistant professors at
  Universit√© de Paris and Institut Jacques Monod.
- New tutorial on `visualizing 3D data <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/applications/plot_3d_image_processing.html>`_ (#4850)
- Documentation has been added to the contributing notes about how to submit a
  gallery example 
- Automatic formatting of docstrings for improved consistency (#4849)
- Improved docstring for ``rgb2lab`` (#4839) and ``marching_cubes`` (#4846)
- Improved docstring for ``measure.marching_cubes``, mentioning how to decimate a
  mesh using mayavi (#4846)
- Improved docstring for ``util.random_noise`` (#5001)
- Improved docstrings for ``morphology.h_maxima`` and ``morphology.h_minima``
  (#4929).
- Improved docstring for ``util.img_as_int`` (#4888).
- An example showing how to explore interactively the properties of labelled
  regions `has been added <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_regionprops.html>`_
  (#5010).
- Documentation has been added to explain
  `how to download example datasets <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/install.html#downloading-all-demo-datasets>`_
  which are not installed with scikit-image (#4984). Similarly, the contributor
  guide has been updated to mention how to host new datasets in a gitlab
  repository (#4892).
- The `benchmarking section of the developer documentation <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/contribute.html#benchmarks>`_ 
  has been expanded (#4905).


Improvements
------------

- In ``skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy``, computations are now be done in
  single-precision when the input image is single-precision. This can give a
  substantial performance improvement when working with single precision data.
- ``pyproject.toml`` has been added to the sdist.
- The performance of the SLIC superpixels algorithm
  (``skimage.segmentation.slice``) was improved for the case where a mask
  is supplied by the user (#4903). The specific superpixels produced by
  masked SLIC will not be identical to those produced by prior releases.
- ``exposure.adjust_gamma`` has been accelerated for ``uint8`` images thanks to a
  LUT (#4966).  
- ``measure.label`` has been accelerated for boolean input images, by using
  ``scipy.ndimage``'s implementation for this case (#4945).
- ``util.apply_parallel`` now works with multichannel data (#4927).
- ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max`` supports now any Minkowski distance.


API Changes
-----------

- A default value has been added to ``measure.find_contours``, corresponding to
  the half distance between the min and max values of the image 
  #4862
- ``skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy`` returns a single-precision output
  when the input is single-precision. Prior to this release, double-precision
  was always used.
- The default value of ``threshold_rel`` in ``skimage.feature.corner`` has
  changed from 0.1 to None, which corresponds to letting 
  ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max`` decide on the default. This is currently
  equivalent to ``threshold_rel=0``.
- ``data.cat`` has been introduced as an alias of ``data.chelsea`` for a more
  descriptive name.
- The ``level`` parameter of ``measure.find_contours`` is now a keyword
  argument, with a default value set to (max(image) - min(image)) / 2.
- ``p_norm`` argument was added to ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max``
  to add support for Minkowski distances.


Bugfixes
--------

- For the RANSAC algorithm, improved the case where all data points are 
  outliers, which was previously raising an error 
  (#4844)
- An error-causing bug has been corrected for the ``bg_color`` parameter in
  ``label2rgb`` when its value is a string (#4840)
- A normalization bug was fixed in ``metrics.variation_of_information`` 
  (#4875)
- Fixed the behaviour of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution for images with 3
  dimensions or more (#4823)
- Euler characteristic property of ``skimage.measure.regionprops`` was erroneous
  for 3D objects, since it did not take tunnels into account. A new implementation
  based on integral geometry fixes this bug.
- In ``skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle`` the ``height`` argument
  controlled the width and the ``width`` argument controlled the height.
  They have been replaced with ``nrow`` and ``ncol``.
- ``skimage.segmentation.flood_fill`` and ``skimage.segmentation.flood``
  now consistently handle negative values for ``seed_point``.
- Segmentation faults in ``segmentation.flood`` have been fixed in #4948 and #4972
- A segfault in ``draw.polygon`` for the case of 0-d input has been fixed
  (#4943).
- In ``registration.phase_cross_correlation``, a ``ValueError`` is raised when
  NaNs are found in the computation (as a result of NaNs in input images).
  Before this fix, an incorrect value could be returned where the input images
  had NaNs (#4886).
- ``min_distance`` is now enforced for ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max``
  (#2592).
- Peak detection in labels is fixed in ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max``
  (#4756).
- Input ``labels`` argument renumbering in ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max``
  is avoided (#5047).


Deprecations
------------

- In ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor``, an ``order`` argument has been
  introduced which will default to 'rc' starting in version 0.20.
- ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigvals`` has been deprecated and will be
  removed in version 0.20. Use ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigenvalues``
  instead.
- The ``skimage.viewer`` subpackage and the ``skivi`` script have been
  deprecated and will be removed in version 0.20. For interactive visualization
  we recommend using dedicated tools such as napari or plotly. In a similar
  vein, the ``qt`` and ``skivi`` plugins of ``skimage.io`` have been deprecated
  and will be removed in version 0.20.
- In ``skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle`` the arguments ``width`` and 
  ``height`` have been deprecated. Use ``nrow`` and ``ncol`` instead.
- The explicit setting ``threshold_rel=0` was removed from the Examples of the
  following docstrings: ``skimage.feature.BRIEF``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_harris``, ``skimage.feature.corner_shi_tomasi``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_foerstner``, ``skimage.feature.corner_fast``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_subpix``, ``skimage.feature.corner_peaks``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_orientations``, and
  ``skimage.feature._detect_octave``.
- In ``skimage.restoration._denoise``, the warning regarding
  ``rescale_sigma=None`` was removed.
- In ``skimage.restoration._cycle_spin``, the ``# doctest: +SKIP`` was removed.
- In ``measure.label``, the deprecated ``neighbors`` parameter has been
  removed.


Development process
-------------------

- Benchmarks can now run on older scikit-image commits (#4891)
- Website analytics are tracked using plausible.io and can be visualized on
  https://plausible.io/scikit-image.org (#4893)
- Artifacts for the documentation build are now found in each pull request
  (#4881).
- Documentation source files can now be written in Markdown in addition to
  ResT, thanks to ``myst`` (#4863).
