New Features
------------


- A new doc tutorial presenting a cell biology example has been added to the
  gallery (#4648). The scientific content benefited from a much appreciated
  review by Pierre Poulain and Fred Bernard, both assistant professors at
  Universit√© de Paris and Institut Jacques Monod.

Improvements

Bugfixes
--------

- In ``skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle`` the ``height`` argument
  controlled the width and the ``width`` argument controlled the height.
  They have been replaced with ``nrow`` and ``ncol``.


Deprecations
------------

- In ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor``, an ``order`` argument has been
  introduced which will default to 'rc' starting in version 0.20.
- ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigvals`` has been deprecated and will be
  removed in version 0.20. Use ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigenvalues``
  instead.
- In ``skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle`` the arguments ``width`` and 
  ``height`` have been depreciated. Use ``nrow`` and ``ncol`` instead.
