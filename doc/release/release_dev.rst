New Features
------------
- Added majority rank filter - ``filters.rank.majority``.


Improvements
------------


API Changes
-----------
- Deprecated subpackage ``skimage.novice`` has been removed.
- Default value of ``multichannel`` parameters has been set to False in
  ``skimage.transform.rescale``, ``skimage.transform.pyramid_reduce``,
  ``skimage.transform.pyramid_laplacian``,
  ``skimage.transform.pyramid_gaussian``, and
  ``skimage.transform.pyramid_expand``. No guessing is performed for 3D arrays
  anymore, so, please, make sure that the parameter is fixed to a proper value.
- Deprecated argument ``visualise`` has been removed from
  ``skimage.feature.hog``. Use ``visualize`` instead.Â¨
- ``skimage.transform.seam_carve`` has been completely removed from the
  library due to licensing restrictions.
- Parameter ``as_grey`` has been removed from ``skimage.data.load`` and
  ``skimage.io.imread``. Use ``as_gray`` instead.
- Parameter ``min_size`` has been removed from
  ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes``. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
- Deprecated ``correct_mesh_orientation`` in ``skimage.measure`` has been
  removed.
- ``skimage.measure._regionprops`` has been completely switched to using
  row-column coordinates. Old x-y interface is not longer available.
- Default value of ``behavior`` parameter has been set to ``ndimage`` in
  ``skimage.filters.median``.
- Parameter ``flatten`` in `skimage.io.imread` has been removed in
  favor of ``as_gray``.
- Parameters ``Hxx, Hxy, Hyy`` have been removed from
  ``skimage.feature.corner.hessian_matrix_eigvals`` in favor of ``H_elems``.
- Default value of ``order`` parameter has been set to ``rc`` in
  ``skimage.feature.hessian_matrix``.
- ``skimage.util.img_as_*`` functions no longer raise precision and/or loss warnings.
