Announcement: scikit-image 0.X.0
================================

We're happy to announce the release of scikit-image v0.X.0!

scikit-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy that includes algorithms
for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation,
analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:

https://scikit-image.org



New Features
------------

- unsharp mask filtering (#2772)
- New options ``connectivity``, ``indices`` and ``allow_borders`` for
  ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``.local_minima``. #3022
- Image translation registration for masked data 
  (``skimage.feature.masked_register_translation``)
- Frangi (vesselness) filter for 3D data
- Meijering (neuriteness) filter for nD data
- Sato (tubeness) filter for 2D and 3D data


Improvements
------------

- Performance of ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``.local_minima`` was
  improved with a new Cython-based implementation. #3022
- ``skivi`` is now using ``qtpy`` for Qt4/Qt5/PySide/PySide2 compatibility (a
  new optional dependency).
- Performance is now monitored by
  `Airspeed Velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Benchmark
  results will appear at https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/


API Changes
-----------

- Parameter ``dynamic_range`` in ``skimage.measure.compare_psnr`` has been
  removed. Use parameter ``data_range`` instead.
- imageio is now the preferred plugin for reading and writing images.
- imageio is now a dependency of scikit-image.
- ``rectangular_grid`` now returns a tuple instead of a list for compatibility
  with numpy 1.15
- ``colorconv.separate_stains`` and ``colorconv.combine_stains`` now uses
  base10 instead of the natural logarithm as discussed in issue #2995.
- Default value of ``clip_negative`` parameter in ``skimage.util.dtype_limits``
  has been set to ``False``.
- Default value of ``circle`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.radon``
  has been set to ``True``.
- Default value of ``circle`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.iradon``
  has been set to ``True``.
- Default value of ``mode`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.swirl``
  has been set to ``reflect``.
- Deprecated ``skimage.filters.threshold_adaptive`` has been removed.
  Use ``skimage.filters.threshold_local`` instead.
- Default value of ``multichannel`` parameter in
  ``skimage.restoration.denoise_bilateral`` has been set to ``False``.
- Default value of ``multichannel`` parameter in
  ``skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means`` has been set to ``False``.
- Default value of ``mode`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.resize``
  and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` has been set to ``reflect``.
- Default value of ``anti_aliasing`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.resize``
  and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` has been set to ``True``.
- Removed the ``skimage.test`` function. This functionality can be achieved
  by calling ``pytest`` directly.


Bugfixes
--------

- Correct bright ridge detection for Frangi filter (#2700)


Deprecations
------------

- Python 2 support has been dropped in the development version. Users of the
  development version should have Python >= 3.5.
- ``skimage.util.montage2d`` has been removed. Use ``skimage.util.montage`` instead.
- ``skimage.novice`` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
- ``skimage.transform.resize`` and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` option
  ``anti_aliasing`` has been enabled by default.
- ``regionprops`` will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can start
  using them now with ``regionprops(..., coordinates='rc')``. You can silence
  warning messages, and retain the old behavior, with
  ``regionprops(..., coordinates='xy')``. However, that option will go away
  in 0.16 and result in an error. This change has a number of consequences.
  Specifically, the "orientation" region property will measure the
  anticlockwise angle from a *vertical* line, i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in
  row-column coordinates.
- ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`` ``min_size`` argument is deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.16. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
