- unsharp mask filtering (#2772)


Improvements

API Changes
-----------



Bugfixes
--------



Deprecations
------------

- Python 2 support has been dropped in the development version. Users of the
  development version should have Python >= 3.5.
- ``skimage.util.montage2d`` has been removed. Use ``skimage.util.montage`` instead.
- ``skimage.novice`` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
- ``skimage.transform.resize`` and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` option
  ``anti_aliasing`` has been enabled by default.
- ``regionprops`` will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can start
  using them now with ``regionprops(..., coordinates='rc')``. You can silence
  warning messages, and retain the old behavior, with
  ``regionprops(..., coordinates='xy')``. However, that option will go away
  in 0.16 and result in an error. This change has a number of consequences.
  Specifically, the "orientation" region property will measure the
  anticlockwise angle from a *vertical* line, i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in
  row-column coordinates.
- ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`` ``min_size`` argument is deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.16. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
