Announcement: scikit-image 0.X.0
================================

We're happy to announce the release of scikit-image v0.X.0!

scikit-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy that includes algorithms
for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation,
analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:

New Features
------------

- Added support for processing images with channels located along any array
  axis. This is in contrast to previous releases where channels were required
  to be the last axis of an image. See more info on the new ``channel_axis``
  argument under the API section of the release notes.
- A no-reference measure of perceptual blur was added
  (``skimage.measure.blur_effect``).
- Non-local means (``skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means``) now supports
  3D multichannel, 4D and 4D multichannel data when ``fast_mode=True``.
- An n-dimensional Fourier-domain Butterworth filter
  (``skimage.filters.butterworth``) was added.
- Color conversion functions now have a new ``channel_axis`` keyword argument
  that allows specification of which axis of an array corresponds to channels.
  For backwards compatibility, this parameter defaults to ``channel_axis=-1``,
  indicating that channels are along the last axis.
- Added a new keyword only parameter ``random_state`` to
  ``morphology.medial_axis`` and ``restoration.unsupervised_wiener``.
- Seeding random number generators will not give the same results as the
  underlying generator was updated to use ``numpy.random.Generator``.
- Added ``saturation`` parameter to ``skimage.color.label2rgb``
- Added normalized mutual information metric
  ``skimage.metrics.normalized_mutual_information``
- threshold_local now supports n-dimensional inputs and anisotropic block_size
- New ``skimage.util.label_points`` function for assigning labels to points.
- Added nD support to several geometric transform classes
- Added ``skimage.metrics.hausdorff_pair`` to find points separated by the
  Hausdorff distance.
- Additional colorspace ``illuminants`` and ``observers`` parameter options
  were added to ``skimage.color.lab2rgb``, ``skimage.color.rgb2lab``,
  ``skimage.color.xyz2lab``, ``skimage.color.lab2xyz``,
  ``skimage.color.xyz2luv`` and ``skimage.color.luv2xyz``.

Improvements
------------

- Many more functions throughout the library now have single precision
  (float32) support.
- Biharmonic  inpainting (``skimage.restoration.inpaint_biharmonic``) was
  refactored and is orders of magnitude faster than before.
- Salt-and-pepper noise generation with ``skimage.util.random_noise`` is now
  faster.
- The performance of the SLIC superpixels algorithm
  (``skimage.segmentation.slice``) was improved for the case where a mask
  is supplied by the user (#4903). The specific superpixels produced by
  masked SLIC will not be identical to those produced by prior releases.
- ``exposure.adjust_gamma`` has been accelerated for ``uint8`` images thanks to
  a LUT (#4966).
- ``measure.label`` has been accelerated for boolean input images, by using
  ``scipy.ndimage``'s implementation for this case (#4945).
- ``util.apply_parallel`` now works with multichannel data (#4927).
- ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max`` supports now any Minkowski distance.
- Fast, non-Cython implementation for ``skimage.filters.correlate_sparse``.
- For efficiency, the histogram is now precomputed within
  ``skimage.filters.try_all_threshold``.
- Faster ``skimage.filters.find_local_max`` when given a finite ``num_peaks``.
- All filters in the ``skimage.filters.rank`` module now release the GIL,
  enabling multithreaded use.
- ``skimage.restoration.denoise_tv_bregman`` and
  ``skimage.restoration.denoise_bilateral`` now release the GIL, enabling
  multithreaded use.
- A ``skimage.color.label2rgb`` performance regression was addressed.


API Changes
-----------

- The ``multichannel`` boolean argument has been deprecated. All functions with
  multichannel support now use an integer ``channel_axis`` to specify which
  axis corresponds to channels. Setting ``channel_axis`` to None is used to
  indicate that the image is grayscale. Specifically, existing code with
  ``multichannel=True`` should be updated to use ``channel_axis=-1`` and code
  with ``multichannel=False`` should now specify ``channel_axis=None``.
- Most functions now return float32 images when the input has float32 dtype.
- A default value has been added to ``measure.find_contours``, corresponding to
  the half distance between the min and max values of the image
  (#4862).
- ``data.cat`` has been introduced as an alias of ``data.chelsea`` for a more
  descriptive name.
- The ``level`` parameter of ``measure.find_contours`` is now a keyword
  argument, with a default value set to ``(max(image) - min(image)) / 2``.
- ``p_norm`` argument was added to ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max``
  to add support for Minkowski distances.
- ``skimage.transforms.integral_image`` now promotes floating point inputs to
  double precision by default (for accuracy). A new ``dtype`` keyword argument
  can be used to override this behavior when desired.
- Color conversion functions now have a new ``channel_axis`` keyword argument
  (see **New Features** section).


Bugfixes
--------

- Input ``labels`` argument renumbering in ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max``
  is avoided (#5047).
- Nonzero values at the image edge are no longer incorrectly marked as a
  boundary when using ``find_bounaries`` with mode='subpixel' (#5447).
