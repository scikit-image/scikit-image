API Changes
-----------
- Deprecated subpackage ``skimage.novice`` has been removed.
- Default value of ``multichannel`` parameters has been set to False in
  ``skimage.transform.rescale``, ``skimage.transform.pyramid_reduce``,
  ``skimage.transform.pyramid_laplacian``,
  ``skimage.transform.pyramid_gaussian``, and
  ``skimage.transform.pyramid_expand``. No guessing is performed for 3D arrays
  anymore, so, please, make sure that the parameter is fixed to a proper value.
- Deprecated argument ``visualise`` has been removed from
  ``skimage.feature.hog``. Use ``visualize`` instead.Â¨
- ``skimage.transform.seam_carve`` has been completely removed from the
  library due to licensing restrictions.
- Parameter ``as_grey`` has been removed from ``skimage.data.load`` and
  ``skimage.io.imread``. Use ``as_gray`` instead.
- Parameter ``min_size`` has been removed from
  ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes``. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
- Deprecated ``correct_mesh_orientation`` in ``skimage.measure`` has been
  removed.
