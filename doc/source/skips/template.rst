Abstract
--------

The abstract should be a short description of what the SKIP will achieve.


Motivation and Scope
--------------------

This section describes the need for the proposed change. It should describe the
existing problem, who it affects, what it is trying to solve, and why. This
section should explicitly address the scope of and key requirements for the
proposed change.


Detailed description
--------------------

This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed change. It
should include examples of how the new functionality would be used, intended
use-cases, and pseudocode illustrating its use.

Related Work
------------

This section should list relevant and/or similar technologies, possibly in
other libraries. It does not need to be comprehensive, just list the major
examples of prior and relevant art.

Implementation
--------------

This section lists the major steps required to implement the SKIP. Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which
steps may be optionally omitted. Where it makes sense, each step should
include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

Any pull requests or developmt branches containing work on this SKIP should
be linked to from here. (A SKIP does not need to be implemented in a single
pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).


Backward compatibility
----------------------

This section describes the ways in which the SKIP breaks backward
compatibility.


Alternatives
------------

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they
should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen
approach.


Discussion
----------

This section may just be a bullet list including links to any discussions
regarding the SKIP, but could also contain additional comments about that
discussion:

- This includes links to mailing list threads or relevant GitHub issues.
