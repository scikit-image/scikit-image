Abstract
--------

The abstract should be a short description of what the SKIP will achieve.


Detailed description
--------------------

This section describes the need for the SKIP. It should describe the
existing problem that it is trying to solve and why this SKIP makes the
situation better. It should include examples of how the new functionality
would be used and perhaps some use cases.


Implementation
--------------

This section lists the major steps required to implement the SKIP.  Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which
steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes sense, each step should
include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

Any pull requests or developmt branches containing work on this SKIP should
be linked to from here. (A SKIP does not need to be implemented in a single
pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).


Backward compatibility
----------------------

This section describes the ways in which the SKIP breaks backward
compatibility.


Alternatives
------------

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they
should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen
approach.


Discussion
----------

This section may just be a bullet list including links to any discussions
regarding the SKIP, but could also contain additional comments about that
discussion:

- This includes links to mailing list threads or relevant GitHub issues.
