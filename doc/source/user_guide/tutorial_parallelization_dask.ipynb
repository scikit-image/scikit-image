    "# Batch processing with Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/) \n",
    "to parallelize a batch processing job. Parallelized code doesn't\n",
    "have to look too different than serial code in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is organized as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Load our images as (dask) arrays.\n",
    "  2. Apply scikit-image filters to our images.\n",
    "  3. Compute and return some important metric about the image.\n",
    "  4. Save resulting images to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference in using dask is that the computation is done in a\n",
    "so called *lazy* fashion. Lazy means that no results are computed until \n",
    "a call to the `compute` function is made. \n",
    "The advantage of parallelization comes when you have access to a machine with\n",
    "many cores. Most modern computers, including laptops and tablet, now have \n",
    "at least two cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the same computation will be done twice, once serially,\n",
    "and a second time using dask. You should experiment with the size and number \n",
    "of the images to compare the performance improvements for different cases."
