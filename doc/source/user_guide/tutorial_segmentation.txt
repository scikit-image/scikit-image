Image Segmentation
------------------

Image segmentation is the task of labeling the pixels of objects of
interest in an image.

In this tutorial, we will see how to segment objects from a background.
We use the ``coins`` image from ``skimage.data``. This image shows
several coins outlined against a darker background. The segmentation of
the coins cannot be done directly from the histogram of grey values,
because the background shares enough grey levels with the coins that a
thresholding segmentation is not sufficient.

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_1.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from skimage import data
    >>> coins = data.coins()
    >>> histo = np.histogram(coins, bins=np.arange(0, 256))

Simply thresholding the image leads either to missing significant parts
of the coins, or to merging parts of the background with the
coins. This is due to the inhomogeneous lighting of the image. 

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_2.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

A first idea is to take advantage of the local contrast, that is, to
use the gradients rather than the grey values. 

Edge-based segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us first try to detect edges that enclose the coins. For edge
detection, we use the `Canny detector 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector>`_ of ``skimage.feature.canny``

::

    >>> from skimage.feature import canny
    >>> edges = canny(coins/255.)

As the background is very smooth, almost all edges are found at the
boundary of the coins, or inside the coins.

::

    >>> from scipy import ndimage
    >>> fill_coins = ndimage.binary_fill_holes(edges)

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_3.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

Now that we have contours that delineate the outer boundary of the coins,
we fill the inner part of the coins using the
``ndimage.binary_fill_holes`` function, which uses mathematical morphology
to fill the holes.

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_4.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

Most coins are well segmented out of the background. Small objects from
the background can be easily removed using the ``ndimage.label``
function to remove objects smaller than a small threshold.

::

    >>> label_objects, nb_labels = ndimage.label(fill_coins)
    >>> sizes = np.bincount(label_objects.ravel())
    >>> mask_sizes = sizes > 20
    >>> mask_sizes[0] = 0
    >>> coins_cleaned = mask_sizes[label_objects]

However, the segmentation is not very satisfying, since one of the coins
has not been segmented correctly at all. The reason is that the contour
that we got from the Canny detector was not completely closed, therefore
the filling function did not fill the inner part of the coin. 

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_5.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

Therefore, this segmentation method is not very robust: if we miss a
single pixel of the contour of the object, we will not be able to fill
it. Of course, we could try to dilate the contours in order to
close them. However, it is preferable to try a more robust method.

Region-based segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us first determine markers of the coins and the background. These
markers are pixels that we can label unambiguously as either object or
background. Here, the markers are found at the two extreme parts of the
histogram of grey values:

::

    >>> markers = np.zeros_like(coins)
    >>> markers[coins < 30] = 1
    >>> markers[coins > 150] = 2
   
We will use these markers in a watershed segmentation. The name watershed
comes from an analogy with hydrology. The `watershed transform
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_%28image_processing%29>`_ floods
an image of elevation starting from markers, in order to determine the catchment
basins of these markers. Watershed lines separate these catchment basins,
and correspond to the desired segmentation.

The choice of the elevation map is critical for good segmentation.
Here, the amplitude of the gradient provides a good elevation map. We
use the Sobel operator for computing the amplitude of the gradient::

    >>> from skimage.filters import sobel
    >>> elevation_map = sobel(coins)

From the 3-D surface plot shown below, we see that high barriers effectively
separate the coins from the background.

.. image:: data/elevation_map.jpg
    :align: center

and here is the corresponding 2-D plot:

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_6.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

The next step is to find markers of the background and the coins based on the
extreme parts of the histogram of grey values::

    >>> markers = np.zeros_like(coins)
    >>> markers[coins < 30] = 1
    >>> markers[coins > 150] = 2

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_7.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

Let us now compute the watershed transform::

    >>> from skimage.morphology import watershed
    >>> segmentation = watershed(elevation_map, markers)

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_8.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center

With this method, the result is satisfying for all coins. Even if the
markers for the background were not well distributed, the barriers in the
elevation map were high enough for these markers to flood the entire 
background.

We remove a few small holes with mathematical morphology::

    >>> segmentation = ndimage.binary_fill_holes(segmentation - 1)

We can now label all the coins one by one using ``ndimage.label``::

    >>> labeled_coins, _ = ndimage.label(segmentation)

.. image:: ../auto_examples/applications/images/plot_coins_segmentation_9.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_coins_segmentation.html
   :align: center
