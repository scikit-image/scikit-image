Parallel image processing
=========================

Sometimes you will need to process batches of images, or images
that do not fit into memory. Here we discuss how you could use `joblib
<https://joblib.readthedocs.io>`__ or `dask
<https://dask.pydata.org>`__ for such tasks.


Batch processing with ``joblib``
--------------------------------

Consider the case where you have several images to be processed, and you want
to calculate the Otsu threshold in all of them:

.. code-block:: python

    from skimage import io, filters, color
    import glob

    # Load all images into memory
    image_files = sorted(glob.glob('*.png'))
    images = [io.imread(image) for image in image_files]

    def threshold(image):
        return filters.threshold_otsu(color.rgb2gray(image))

    # Process all images serially and store the result
    thresholds = [threshold(image) for image in images]

The code above could be improved in two aspects: first, it attempts to load
*all* image data into memory at once. Second, it processes the images serially,
not using more than one CPU core.

Instead, we can use ``joblib`` to parallelize the batch processing as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from joblib import Parallel, delayed

    image_files = sorted(glob.glob('*.png'))

    def load_and_threshold(image_fn):
        image = io.imread(image_fn)
        return filters.threshold_otsu(color.rgb2gray(image))

    threshold_tasks = [delayed(load_and_threshold)(fn) for fn in image_files]

    p = Parallel(n_jobs=-1, backend='threading')
    thresholds = p(threshold_tasks)

The ``delayed`` call prevents ``load_and_threshold`` from executing immediately
while setting up the parallel processing. Instead, it becomes a task that can
be scheduled. Setting ``n_jobs`` to ``-1`` tells ``joblib`` to use all cores
available.

Note that thresholding is not the best example of ``joblib`` usage: speedups
can only be expected in the case where the individual operations are somewhat
long running. Otherwise, the overhead of scheduling and executing tasks can be
more than what is gained by executing in parallel.


Using ``joblib`` in user-defined pipelines
------------------------------------------

You can also use ``joblib`` when creating image processing pipelines in your
own functions. In the following example, we set up the function ``task``:
first, it applies the total variation Chambolle filter; then, it returns the
histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptor of the input image.

.. code-block:: python

    import skimage as ski

    def task(image):
        """
        Apply some functions and return an image.
        """
        image = ski.restoration.denoise_tv_chambolle(
            image[0][0], weight=0.1, channel_axis=-1
        )
        fd, hog_image = ski.feature.hog(
            ski.color.rgb2gray(image),
            orientations=8,
            pixels_per_cell=(16, 16),
            cells_per_block=(1, 1),
            visualize=True
        )
        return hog_image

    # Prepare images
    hubble = ski.data.hubble_deep_field()
    width = 10
    pics = ski.util.view_as_windows(
        hubble, (width, hubble.shape[1], hubble.shape[2]), step=width
    )

To call the function ``task`` on each element of the list ``pics``, it is
usual to write a for loop. To measure the execution time of this loop, you can
use ``ipython`` and measure the execution time with ``%timeit``.

.. code-block:: python

    def classic_loop():
        for image in pics:
            task(image)

    %timeit classic_loop()

Another equivalent way to code this loop is to use a comprehension list, which has the same efficiency.

.. code-block:: python

    def comprehension_loop():
        [task(image) for image in pics]

    %timeit comprehension_loop()

``joblib`` is a library providing an easy way to parallelize for loops once we have a comprehension list.
The number of jobs can be specified.

.. code-block:: python

    from joblib import Parallel, delayed
    def joblib_loop():
        Parallel(n_jobs=4)(delayed(task)(i) for i in pics)

    %timeit joblib_loop()


Batch processing with ``dask``
------------------------------

In ``dask``, the Otsu threshold processing looks as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from dask import delayed, compute

    image_files = sorted(glob.glob('*.png'))

    def load_and_threshold(image_fn):
        image = io.imread(image_fn)
        return filters.threshold_otsu(color.rgb2gray(image))

    threshold_tasks = [delayed(load_and_threshold)(fn) for fn in image_files]
    thresholds = compute(threshold_tasks)

``dask`` can also deploy tasks across multiple nodes (computers) by
using the `distributed <http://distributed.readthedocs.io>`__
scheduler.


Tiled processing of large images with ``dask``
----------------------------------------------

When a large image is processed, we can often improve performance by
a) parallelizing computation and b) reducing the amount of memory
used at any point in time.
