Handling Video Files
--------------------

Sometimes it is necessary to read a sequence of images from a standard video
file, such as .avi and .mov files.

In a scientific context, it is usually better to avoid these formats in favor
of a simple directory of images or a multi-dimensional TIF. Video formats are
more difficult to read piecemeal, typically do not support random frame access
or research-minded meta data, and use lossy compression if not carefully
configured. But video files are in widespread use, and they are easy to share,
so it is convenient to be equipped to read and write them when necessary.

Tools for reading video files vary in their ease of installation and use, their
disk and memory usage, and their cross-platform compatibility.  This is a
practical guide.

A Workaround: Convert the Video to an Image Sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a one-off solution, the simplest, surest route is to convert the video to a
collection of sequentially-numbered image files, usually called an image
sequence. Then the images files can be read into an `ImageCollection` by
`skimage.io.imread_collection`. Converting the video to frames can be done
easily in [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), a cross-platform, GUI-based
program from the bio-imaging community, or [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), a
powerful command-line utility for manipulating video files. 

In FFmpeg, the following command generates an image file from each frame in a
video. The files are numbered with five digits, padded on the left with zeros.

.. code-block:: bash
   ffmpeg -i "video.mov" -f image2 "video-frame%05d.png"

More information is available in an `FFmpeg tutorial on image sequences 
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FFMPEG_An_Intermediate_Guide/image_sequence#Making_an_Image_Sequence_from_a_video>`__.

Generating an image sequence has disadvantages: they can be large and unwieldy,
and generating them can take some time. It is generally preferrable to work
directly with the original video file. For a more direct solution, we need to
execute FFmpeg or LibAV from Python to read frames from the video.
FFmpeg and LibAV are two large open-source
projects that decode video from the sprawling variety of formats used in the
wild. There are several ways to use them from Python. Each, unfortunately,
has some disadvantages.

OpenCV
^^^^^^

One solution is the `VideoReader
<http://docs.opencv.org/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html#videocapture-open>`__
class in OpenCV, which has bindings to FFmpeg. OpenCV can be difficult to
install, especially because it must be linked to FFmpeg to support reading video
from files. Even if installed correctly, it is known to get the meta data wrong
for some video codecs. (See `this issue <http://code.opencv.org/issues/481>`__.)

PyAV
^^^^

`PyAV <http://mikeboers.github.io/PyAV/>`__ uses FFmpeg's (or LibAV's) libraries
to read image data directly from the video file. It invokes them using Cython
bindings, so it is very fast.

.. code-block:: python
   import av
   v = pims.open('path/to/video.mov')

PyAV is pip-installable (`pip install av`) on Linux and OSX. Unfortunately,
PyAV does not yet work on Windows.

PIMS
^^^^

The `Video` class in `PIMS <github.com/soft-matter/pims>`__ invokes PyAV and
adds additional functionality to solve a common problem in scientific
applications, accessing a video by frame number. Unfortunately, video file
formats are designed to be searched in an approximate way by time, and they do
not support any way of querying a specific frame number. PIMS adds this missing
functionality by decoding (but not reading) the entire video at and producing an
internal table of contents that supports indexing by frame.

.. code-block:: python

   import pims
   v = pims.Video('path/to/video.mov')
   v[-1]  # a 2D numpy array representing the last frame

MoviePy
^^^^^^^

`Moviepy <http://zulko.github.io/moviepy>`__ pipes the decoded video from FFmpeg
into RAM and reads it out. This is straightforward, but impossible for large
videos that exceed available RAM. It works on all floats if FFmpeg is installed.

.. code-block:: python

    from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
    myclip = VideoFileClip("some_video.avi")

Imageio
^^^^^^^^

`Imageio <http://imageio.github.io/>`_ offers a way to load video using FFmpeg. It's quite similar to moviepy.

.. code-block:: python

    import imageio
    filename = '/tmp/file.mp4'
    vid = imageio.get_reader(filename,  'ffmpeg')

    for num, image in vid.iter_data():
        print(image.mean())

    metadata = vid.get_meta_data()
