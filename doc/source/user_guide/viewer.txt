Scikits-image viewer
====================


`skimage.viewer` provides a matplotlib_-based `ImageViewer` for displaying images, with the goal of making
it easy to create interactive image editors. You can simply use it to display
an image::

   >>> from skimage import data
   >>> from skimage.viewer import ImageViewer

   >>> image = data.camera()

   >>> view = ImageViewer(image)
   >>> view.show()

Of course, you can easily use matplotlib's `imshow` function (or alternatively,
`skimage.io.imshow` which adds support for multiple io-plugins) to display
images. The advantage of `ImageViewer` is that you can (fairly) easily add
plugins. Before discussing how to do that, let's list some important attributes
of `ImageViewer`::


    image : array
        Image being viewed. Setting this value will update the displayed frame.
    canvas, fig, ax : matplotlib canvas, figure, and axes
        matplotlib canvas, figure, and axes used to display image.
    plugins : list
        List of attached plugins.

`ImageViewer.image` is implemented as a property---so that setting `image`
will update the displayed plot. Also, you can see from the list above that you
have access to matplotlib `canvas`, `figure`, and `axes` objects if needed.

The final attribute listed above is just a Python list of plugins, which
contains references to plugins for manipulating images. Currently, only a few
plugins are implemented, but it should be fairly easy to write your own. Before
going into the details, let's see an example of how a plugin is added to the
viewer::

   >>> import skimage
   >>> from skimage.viewer.plugins import EdgeDetector

   >>> image = skimage.img_as_float(data.camera())
   >>> view = ImageViewer(image)
   >>> EdgeDetector(view)
   >>> view.show()

As you can see above, the plugin (here, `EdgeDetector`) is simply initialized
with the viewer. This call adds the viewer to the plugin (which is required
because the plugin is manipulating the image and needs to update the viewer),
and under the hood, the plugin is adding itself to the viewer (this cross
reference is used to clean things up if the viewer is closed---it isn't too
important to understand).

To explain how to create a plugin, let's look at a slightly-simplified version
of `EdgeDetector`. The main parts to notice are that the plugin 1) subclasses
`Plugin`, 2) takes an `ImageViewer` instance as an argument, and 3) creates its 
own `figure`, which holds some slider widgets for adjusting the parameters of
the edge detector:

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   from skimage.filter import canny
   from skimage.viewer.plugins.base import Plugin
   from skimage.viewer.widgets.slider import Slider

   class EdgeDetector(Plugin):
       """Plugin to detect edges in an image using a Sobel detector.

       Parameters
       ----------
       image_viewer : ImageViewer instance.
           Window containing image used in measurement.
       """

       def __init__(self, image_viewer, sigma_range=(0, 5), low_range=(0, 1),
                    high_range=(0, 1)):
           # custom figure to control the layout of sliders
           figure, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3, figsize=(6, 1))
           Plugin.__init__(self, image_viewer, figure=figure)

           # unpack the 3 axes created above and use them for slider widgets.
           ax_sigma, ax_low, ax_high = axes
           self.slider_sigma = Slider(ax_sigma, sigma_range, label='sigma',
                                      value=1, on_release=self.update_image)
           self.slider_low = Slider(ax_low, low_range, label='low',
                                    value=0.5, on_release=self.update_image)
           self.slider_high = Slider(ax_high, high_range, label='high',
                                     value=0.7, on_release=self.update_image)

           # save original image b/c we always want to filter the original.
           self.original_image = self.imgview.image.copy()
           self.update_image()

       def update_image(self, event=None):

           self.imgview.image = canny(self.original_image,
                                      sigma=self.slider_sigma.value,
                                      low_threshold=self.slider_low.value,
                                      high_threshold=self.slider_high.value)
           self.imgview.redraw()

This plugin defines an `update_image` method to run the `canny` edge detector
on the image. This method is called whenever you adjust the sliders, which
control the parameters to `canny`.

The actual implementation of `EdgeDetector` has a few other parts (slightly
enhancing user-interaction and aesthetics), but this is really all you need to
write your own plugin.
