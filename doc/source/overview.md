# scikit-image: image processing in Python

[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) builds on
[scipy.ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html) to
provide a versatile set of image processing routines in
[Python](https://www.python.org).

This library is developed by its community, and
{doc}`contributions <contribute>` are most welcome!

Read about our {doc}`mission, vision, and values <values>` and how we
{doc}`govern <skips/1-governance>` the project.

Major proposals to the project are documented in {doc}`SKIPs <skips/index>`.
