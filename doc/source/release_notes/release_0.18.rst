  (#5010).
- Documentation has been added to explain
  `how to download example datasets <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/install.html#downloading-all-demo-datasets>`_
  which are not installed with scikit-image (#4984). Similarly, the contributor
  guide has been updated to mention how to host new datasets in a gitlab

Improvements
------------

- float32 support for SLIC (#4683), ORB (#4684, #4697), BRIEF (#4685),
  ``pyramid_gaussian`` (#4696), Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (#4880)
- In ``skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy``, computations are now done in
  single-precision when the input image is single-precision. This can give a
  substantial performance improvement when working with single precision data.
- Richardson-Lucy deconvolution now has a ``filter_epsilon`` keyword argument
  to avoid division by very small numbers (#4823)
- Add default level parameter (max-min) / 2 in ``measure.find_contours`` (#4862)
- The performance of the SLIC superpixels algorithm
  (``skimage.segmentation.slice``) was improved for the case where a mask
  is supplied by the user (#4903). The specific superpixels produced by
  masked SLIC will not be identical to those produced by prior releases.
- ``exposure.adjust_gamma`` has been accelerated for ``uint8`` images by using
  a look-up table (LUT) (#4966).
- ``measure.label`` has been accelerated for boolean input images, by using
  ``scipy.ndimage``'s implementation for this case (#4945).
- ``util.apply_parallel`` now works with multichannel data (#4927).
- ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max`` supports now any Minkowski distance.
- We now use sparse cross-correlation to accelerate local thresholding
  functions (#4912)
- ``morphology.convex_hull_image`` now uses much less memory by checking hull
  inequalities in sequence (#5020)
- Polygon rasterization is more precise and will no longer potentially exclude
  input vertices. (#5029)
- Add data optional requirements to allow pip install scikit-image[data]
  (#5105, #5111)
- OpenMP support in MSVC (#4924, #5111)
- Restandardize handling of Multi-Image files (#2815, #5132)
- Consistent zoom boundary behavior across SciPy versions (#5131, #5133)

API Changes
-----------

- ``skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy`` returns a single-precision output
  when the input is single-precision. Prior to this release, double-precision
  was always used. (#4880)
- The default value of ``threshold_rel`` in ``skimage.feature.corner`` has
  changed from 0.1 to None, which corresponds to letting
  ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max`` decide on the default. This is currently
  equivalent to ``threshold_rel=0``.
- In ``measure.label``, the deprecated ``neighbors`` parameter has been
  removed. (#4942)
- The image returned by ``data.camera`` has changed because of copyright
  issues (#4913).

Bug fixes
---------

- A bug in ``label2rgb`` has been fixed when the input image had np.uint8
  dtype (#4661)
- Fixed incorrect implementation of ``skimage.color.separate_stains`` (#4725)
- Many bug fixes have been made in ``peak_local_max`` (#2592, #4756, #4760,
  #5047)
- Fix bug in ``random_walker`` when input labels have negative values (#4771)
- PSF flipping is now correct for Richardson-Lucy deconvolution work in >2D (#4823)
- Fix equalize_adapthist (CLAHE) for clip value 1.0 (#4828)
- For the RANSAC algorithm, improved the case where all data points are
  outliers, which was previously raising an error
  (#4844)
- An error-causing bug has been corrected for the ``bg_color`` parameter in
  ``label2rgb`` when its value is a string (#4840)
- A normalization bug was fixed in ``metrics.variation_of_information``
  (#4875)
- Euler characteristic property of ``skimage.measure.regionprops`` was erroneous
  for 3D objects, since it did not take tunnels into account. A new implementation
  based on integral geometry fixes this bug (#4380).
- In ``skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle`` the ``height`` argument
  controlled the width and the ``width`` argument controlled the height.
  They have been replaced with ``nrow`` and ``ncol``. (#4906)
- ``skimage.segmentation.flood_fill`` and ``skimage.segmentation.flood``
  now consistently handle negative values for ``seed_point``.
- Segmentation faults in ``segmentation.flood`` have been fixed (#4948, #4972)
- A segfault in ``draw.polygon`` for the case of 0-d input has been fixed
  (#4943).
- In ``registration.phase_cross_correlation``, a ``ValueError`` is raised when
  NaNs are found in the computation (as a result of NaNs in input images).
  Before this fix, an incorrect value could be returned where the input images
  had NaNs (#4886).
- Fix edge filters not respecting padding mode (#4907)
- Use v{} for version tags with pooch (#5104, #5110)
- Fix compilation error in XCode 12 (#5107, #5111)

Deprecations
------------

- The ``indices`` argument in ``skimage.feature.peak_local_max`` has been
  deprecated. Indices will always be returned. (#4752)
- In ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor``, an ``order`` argument has been
  introduced which will default to 'rc' starting in version 0.20. (#4841)
- ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigvals`` has been deprecated and will be
  removed in version 0.20. Use ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigenvalues``
  instead.
- The ``skimage.viewer`` subpackage and the ``skivi`` script have been
  deprecated and will be removed in version 0.20. For interactive visualization
  we recommend using dedicated tools such as `napari <https://napari.org>`_ or
  `plotly <https://plotly.com>`_. In a similar vein, the ``qt`` and ``skivi``
  plugins of ``skimage.io`` have been deprecated
  and will be removed in version 0.20. (#4941, #4954)
- In ``skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle`` the arguments ``width`` and
  ``height`` have been deprecated. Use ``nrow`` and ``ncol`` instead.
- The explicit setting ``threshold_rel=0` was removed from the Examples of the
  following docstrings: ``skimage.feature.BRIEF``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_harris``, ``skimage.feature.corner_shi_tomasi``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_foerstner``, ``skimage.feature.corner_fast``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_subpix``, ``skimage.feature.corner_peaks``,
  ``skimage.feature.corner_orientations``, and
  ``skimage.feature._detect_octave``.
- In ``skimage.restoration._denoise``, the warning regarding
  ``rescale_sigma=None`` was removed.
- In ``skimage.restoration._cycle_spin``, the ``# doctest: +SKIP`` was removed.

A warm thank you to all contributors who added to this release. A fraction of contributors were first-time contributors to open source and a much larger fraction first-time contributors to scikit-image. It's a great feeling for maintainers to welcome new contributors, and the diversity of scikit-image contributors is surely a big strength of the package.
