# scikit-image WASM wheels local index

# This is a stub directory that stores the Pyodide/WASM wheels built as a part of
# the CircleCI doc build process, which are then indexed by JupyterLite and shipped
# to become available in the JupyterLite environment for installation with the
# Python (Pyodide) kernel. When running locally, a user can drop wheels here to
#test them in the JupyterLite environment, and install them using `piplite` via the
# `%pip install` magic command. Note that in some cases where the Pyodide distribution
# contains a version of the package that you want already, you need to embed the
# version of the package you want to install in the install command, based on its
# wheel filename, so that it is picked up by `piplite` from the local index rather
# than preferring other indices such as PyPI (pure Python packages not in PyPI) or
# jsDelivr (what Pyodide uses for pure and non-pure Python packages that it ships).
