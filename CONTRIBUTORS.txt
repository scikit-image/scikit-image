# Acknowledgements

scikit-image is a joint effort, created by a large community of contributors.
For a full list of contributors, please visit
[our GitHub repo](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/graphs/contributors)
or use `git` in the source repository as follows:

```
git shortlog --summary --numbered

```

Previously, we asked authors to add their names to this file whenever
they made a contribution.  Because these additions were not made
consistently, we now refer to the git commit log as the ultimate
record of code contribution.

Please note that, on a project as large as this, there are *many*
different ways to contribute, of which code is only one.  Other
contributions include community & project management, code review,
answering questions on forums, and web design.  We are grateful for
each and every contributor, regardless of their role.
