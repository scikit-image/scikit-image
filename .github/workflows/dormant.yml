            Hey, there hasn't been any activity on this for more than 180
            days, so we have marked it as "dormant" for now until there is some
            new activity. Feel free to reach out to people directly by
            mentioning them here or on our
            [forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/skimage/22)
            if more feedback is needed! If you feel that this issue is no longer
            relevant you may close it by yourself; otherwise, we may do it at
            some point (either way, it will be done manually).
            In any case, thank you for your contributions so far!

            update if you plan to continue this or if you are okay with someone
            else taking over.
            In any case, thank you for your contributions so far!
