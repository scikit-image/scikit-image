            Hey, there hasn't been any recent activity on this for more than 180
            days, so we have marked it as "dormant" for now until there is some
            new activity. Please, feel free to reach out to people directly by
            mentioning them here or on our
            [forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/skimage/22)
            if more feedback is needed! If you feel that this issue is no longer
            relevant you may close this or we may do it at some point manually.
            In any case, thank you for your contributions so far!
