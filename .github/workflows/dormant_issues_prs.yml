            Hello scikit-image core devs! There hasn't been any activity on
            this issue for more than 180 days. I have marked it as "dormant" to
            make it easy to find.

            To our contributors, thank you for your contribution and apologies
            if this issue fell through the cracks! Hopefully this ping will
            help bring some fresh attention to the issue. If you need help, you
            can always reach out on our
            [forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/skimage/22)

            If you think that this issue is no longer relevant, you may close
            it, or we may do it at some point (either way, it will be done
            manually).
