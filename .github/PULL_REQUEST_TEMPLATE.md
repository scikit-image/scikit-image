## AI policy

We are a small developer team, and we enjoy reviewing code written by other humans.
We're not making grand claims about the future AI in coding; LLM contributions are just not a good fit for us.
In order to make a sensible PR, you must understand the changes proposed—we are going to be talking to _you_ about them, not to an LLM.
Because licensing is also important to us, you will also need to know the copyright of any changes provided.
If you want to play it safe, write the code yourself.
If you decide to use LLMs regardless, please indicate _how_ in the description.

## Release note

For maintainers and optionally contributors, please refer to the [instructions](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/development/contribute.html#documenting-changes) on how to document this PR for the release notes.
