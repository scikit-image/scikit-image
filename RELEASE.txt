How to make a new release of ``skimage``
========================================

- Update release notes.

  - To show a list contributors, run ``doc/release/contributors.sh <commit>``,
    where ``<commit>`` is the first commit since the previous release.

- Update the version number in ``setup.py`` and ``bento.info`` and commit

- Update the docs:

  - Edit ``doc/source/themes/agogo/static/docversions.js`` and commit
  - Build a clean version of the docs.  Run ``make`` in the root dir, then
    ``rm build -rf; make html`` in the docs.
  - Run ``make html`` again to copy the newly generated ``random.js`` into
    place.  Double check ``random.js``, otherwise the skimage.org front
    page gets broken!
  - Build using ``make gh-pages``.
  - Push upstream: ``git push`` in ``doc/gh-pages``.

- Add the version number as a tag in git::

   git tag v0.X.0

- Push the new meta-data to github::

   git push --tags origin master

- Publish on PyPi::

   python setup.py register
   python setup.py sdist upload

- Increase the version number

  - In ``setup.py``, set to ``0.Xdev``.
  - In ``bento.info``, set to ``0.X.dev0``.

- Update the web frontpage:
  The webpage is kept in a separate repo: scikit-image-web

  - Sync your branch with the remote repo: ``git pull``.
    If you try to ``make gh-pages`` when your branch is out of sync, it
    creates headaches.
  - Update stable and development version numbers in
    ``_templates/sidebar_versions.html``.
  - Add release date to ``index.rst`` under "Announcements".
  - Build using ``make gh-pages``.
  - Push upstream: ``git push`` in ``gh-pages``.

- Post release notes on mailing lists, blog, G+, etc.

For the last lines above to work, you need ``~/.gbp.conf``::

  [DEFAULT]
  upstream-tag = %(version)s

  [git-buildpackage]
  sign-tags = True
  export-dir = ../build-area/
  tarball-dir = ../tarballs/

As well as ``~/dput.cf``::

  [mentors]
  fqdn = mentors.debian.net
  incoming = /upload
  method = http
  allow_unsigned_uploads = 0
  progress_indicator = 2
  # Allow uploads for UNRELEASED packages
  allowed_distributions = .*
