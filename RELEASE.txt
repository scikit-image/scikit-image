How to make a new release of ``skimage``
========================================

- Check ``TODO.txt`` for any outstanding tasks.

- Update release notes.

  1. Review and cleanup ``doc/release/release_dev.txt``

     - To show a list of merges and contributors, run
       ``doc/release/contribs.py <tag of prev release>``.

  2. Rename to ``doc/release/release_X.txt``

  3. Copy ``doc/release/release_template.txt`` to
     ``doc/release/release_dev.txt`` for the next release.

- Update the version number in ``skimage/__init__.py`` and ``bento.info`` and commit

- Update the docs:

  - Edit ``doc/source/_static/docversions.js`` and commit
  - Build a clean version of the docs.  Run ``python setup.py install`` in the
    root dir, then ``rm -rf build; make html`` in the docs.
  - Run ``make html`` again to copy the newly generated ``random.js`` into
    place.  Double check ``random.js``, otherwise the skimage.org front
    page gets broken!
  - Build using ``make gh-pages``.
  - Update the symlink to ``stable``.
  - Push upstream: ``git push origin gh-pages`` in ``doc/gh-pages``.

- Add the version number as a tag in git::

   git tag -s v0.X.0

  (If you do not have a gpg key, use -m instead; it is important for
  Debian packaging that the tags are annotated)

- Push the new meta-data to github::

   git push --tags origin master

- Publish on PyPi::

   python setup.py register
   python setup.py sdist upload

  Go to https://travis-ci.org/scikit-image/scikit-image-wheels, select the
  "Current" tab, and click (on the right) on the "Restart Build" icon.  After
  the wheels become available at http://wheels.scikit-image.org/ (approx 15
  mins), execute ``tools/osx_wheel_upload.sh``.  Note that, if you rebuild the
  same wheels, it can take up to 15 minutes for the the files in the http
  directory to update to the versions that Travis-CI uploaded. You may want to
  check the timestamps in the http directory listing to check that you will get
  the latest version.

- Increase the version number

  - In ``setup.py``, set to ``0.Xdev``.
  - In ``bento.info``, set to ``0.X.dev0``.

- Update the web frontpage:
  The webpage is kept in a separate repo: scikit-image-web

  - Sync your branch with the remote repo: ``git pull``.
    If you try to ``make gh-pages`` when your branch is out of sync, it
    creates headaches.
  - Add release date to ``index.rst`` under "Announcements".
  - Add previous stable version documentation path to disallowed paths
    in `robots.txt`
  - Build using ``make gh-pages``.
  - Push upstream: ``git push origin master`` in ``gh-pages``.

- Update the development docs for the new version ``0.Xdev`` just like above

- Post release notes on mailing lists, blog, G+, etc.

Debian
------

- Tag the release as per instructions above.
- git checkout debian
- git merge v0.x.x
- uscan <- not sure if this step is necessary
- Update changelog (emacs has a good mode, requires package dpkg-dev-el)
  - C-C C-v add new version, C-c C-c timestamp / save
- git commit -m 'Changelog entry for 0.x.x'
- git-buildpackage -uc -us -rfakeroot
- Sign the changes: debsign skimage_0.x.x-x_amd64.changes
- cd ../build-area && dput mentors skimage_0.x.x-x_amd64.changes
- The package should now be available at:

  http://mentors.debian.net/package/skimage

For the last lines above to work, you need ``~/.gbp.conf``::

  [DEFAULT]
  upstream-tag = %(version)s

  [git-buildpackage]
  sign-tags = True
  export-dir = ../build-area/
  tarball-dir = ../tarballs/

As well as ``~/dput.cf``::

  [mentors]
  fqdn = mentors.debian.net
  incoming = /upload
  method = http
  allow_unsigned_uploads = 0
  progress_indicator = 2
  # Allow uploads for UNRELEASED packages
  allowed_distributions = .*
