How to make a new release of ``skimage``
========================================

- Update release notes.
- Update the version number in setup.py and bento.info and commit
- Update the docs:
  - Edit ``doc/source/themes/agogo/static/docversions.js`` and commit
  - Build a clean version of the docs.  Run "make" in the root dir, then
    ``rm build -rf; make html`` in the docs.
  - Run ``make html`` again to copy the newly generated ``random.js`` into
    place.
  - Push upstream using "make gh-pages"
- Add the version number as a tag in git::

  git tag v0.6

- Push the new meta-data to github::

  git push --tags origin master

- Publish on PyPi:

  python setup.py register
  python setup.py sdist upload

- Increase the version number in the setup.py file to ``0.Xdev``.

- Update the web frontpage:
  The webpage is kept in a separate repo: scikits-image-web
  - ``_templates/sidebar_versions.html``
  - ``index.rst``

- Post release notes on mailing lists, blog, G+, etc.
