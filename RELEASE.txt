How to make a new release of ``skimage``
========================================

While following this guide, note down all the times that you need to consult a
previous release manager, or that you find an instruction unclear. You will
make a PR to update these notes after you are done with the release. ;-)

- Check ``TODO.txt`` for any outstanding tasks.

- Branch v<major>.<minor>.x from master. This is the "release branch", where
  you will make your changes gearing up for release, and cherry-pick them as
  appropriate to master.

- On the release branch, update the release notes:

  1. Review and cleanup ``doc/release/release_dev.txt``.

  2. Make a list of merges, contributors, and reviewers by running
     ``doc/release/contribs.py <tag of previous release>``.

  3. Paste this list at the end of the ``release_dev.txt``.

  4. Scan the PR titles for highlights, deprecations, API changes,
     and bugfixes, and mention these in the relevant sections of the notes.
     Try to present the information in an expressive way by mentioning
     the affected functions, elaborating on the changes and their
     consequences. If possible, organize semantically close PRs in groups.

  5. Rename the file to ``doc/release/release_<major>.<minor>.txt``

  6. Copy ``doc/release/release_template.txt`` to
     ``doc/release/release_dev.txt`` for the next release.

  7. Copy relevant deprecations from ``release_<major>_<minor>.txt``
     to ``release_dev.txt``.

- Submit the release notes for review by other project maintainers:

  - Create a PR from v<major>.<minor>.x branch to master (at this point,
    the difference should show the full contents of the release notes).
  - Discuss with others, and make the changes directly to v<major>.<minor>.x branch.
  - Once the consensus is found, ask the project maintainers to merge the PR.

- In the master branch, update the version number in ``skimage/__init__.py``
  to the next ``.dev0`` version, commit, and push. This should follow PEP440
  meaning that the appropriate version number would look something like
  ``0.20.dev0`` with the period beteween ``20`` and ``dev`` and a trailing
  ``0`` immediately after ``dev``. 

- Back on the release branch, update the version number to stable in
  ``skimage/__init__.py``, commit, and push.

- Update the docs:

  - Edit ``doc/source/_static/docversions.js`` and commit
  - Build a clean version of the docs.  Run ``python setup.py install`` in the
    root dir, then ``rm -rf build; make html`` in the ``doc`` dir.
  - Build using ``make gh-pages``.
  - Update the symlink to ``stable``.
  - Push upstream: ``git push origin gh-pages`` in ``doc/gh-pages``.

- Add the version number as a tag in git::

   git tag -s -m <github_release_message> [-u <key-id>] v<major>.<minor>.0

  (If you do not have a GPG key, follow the tutorial to set it up:
   https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/)

- Push the new tag to GitHub::

   git push upstream v<major>.<minor>.0

  (where ``upstream`` is the name of the
   ``github.com:scikit-image/scikit-image`` repository.)

- Make sure you have all the required write permissions (if not, you will need
  to ask St√©fan or Juan to grant you the access), specifically, to:

  - https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image-wheels
  - https://pypi.org/project/scikit-image/
  - https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image-web

- Build the package wheels (pre-compiled binaries) for various platforms:

  - Clone https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image-wheels.
  - Update its ``.travis.yml`` file so that ``BUILD_COMMIT`` points to this
    release tag (e.g. ``v0.14.0``).
  - Commit and push.
  - Wait until the corresponding wheels appear at
    http://wheels.scikit-image.org (about 15 minutes).

- Upload the wheels to PyPI:

  - Make sure ``twine`` is available. You can install it with
    ``pip install twine``.
  - Download ``wheel-uploader`` [1]_ and place it on your PATH.
  - Run ``tools/upload_wheels.sh``.

.. [1] https://github.com/MacPython/terryfy/blob/master/wheel-uploader

- Publish the source distribution on PyPi::

   python setup.py sdist
   twine upload dist/scikit-image-<major>.<minor>.0.tar.gz

- Update the web frontpage:
  The webpage is kept in a separate repo: scikit-image-web

  - Sync your branch with the remote repo: ``git pull``.
    If you try to ``make gh-pages`` when your branch is out of sync, it
    creates headaches.
  - Add release date to ``index.rst`` under "News".
  - Add previous stable version documentation path to disallowed paths
    in `robots.txt`
  - Build using ``make gh-pages``.
  - Push upstream: ``git push origin master`` in ``gh-pages``.

- Post release notes on mailing lists, blog, Twitter, etc.

  - scikit-image@python.org
  - scipy-user@python.org
  - scikit-learn@python.org

- Update the version and the release date on Wikipedia
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-image

Conda-forge
-----------

A scikit-image build recipe resides at
http://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-image-feedstock. You should update it to
point to the most recent release. You can do this by following these steps:

- Fork the repository at http://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-image-feedstock,
  and clone it to your machine.
- Sprout a new branch, e.g. ``v<major>.<minor>``.
- Find out the SHA256 hash of the source distribution. You can find this at
  https://pypi.org/project/scikit-image/, or use the following commands:

  - ``sha256sum path/to/scikit-image-*.tar.gz`` (Linux)
  - ``shasum -a 256 dist/scikit-image-*.tar.gz`` (macOS)
  - ``CertUtil -hashfile dist\scikit-image-*.tar.gz SHA256`` (Windows)

- Edit the file ``recipe/meta.yaml``:

  - Update the version number on the first line.
  - Update the SHA256 value on line 9.
  - If necessary, reset the build number to 0. (line 12)
  - Update any requirements in the appropriate sections (build or run).
    Note: don't remove ``numpy x.x``. This tells conda-smithy, conda-forge's
    build system, that the library must be linked against NumPy at build time.

- Commit the changes, push to your fork, and submit a pull request to the
  upstream repo.

Debian
------

The below instructions remain here for completeness. However, the Debian
scientific team has kindly taken over package maintenance. Simply follow the
procedure described at https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting to report a "bug"
that there is a new version of scikit-image out (specifying the version
number), with severity set to "Wishlist".

If you want to take matters into your own hands for some reason, follow the
instructions detailed below to cut a Debian release yourself.

- Tag the release as per instructions above.
- git checkout debian
- git merge v0.x.x
- uscan <- not sure if this step is necessary
- Update changelog (emacs has a good mode, requires package dpkg-dev-el)
  - C-C C-v add new version, C-c C-c timestamp / save
- git commit -m 'Changelog entry for 0.x.x'
- git-buildpackage -uc -us -rfakeroot
- Sign the changes: debsign skimage_0.x.x-x_amd64.changes
- cd ../build-area && dput mentors skimage_0.x.x-x_amd64.changes
- The package should now be available at:

  http://mentors.debian.net/package/skimage

For the last lines above to work, you need ``~/.gbp.conf``::

  [DEFAULT]
  upstream-tag = %(version)s

  [git-buildpackage]
  sign-tags = True
  export-dir = ../build-area/
  tarball-dir = ../tarballs/

As well as ``~/dput.cf``::

  [mentors]
  fqdn = mentors.debian.net
  incoming = /upload
  method = http
  allow_unsigned_uploads = 0
  progress_indicator = 2
  # Allow uploads for UNRELEASED packages
  allowed_distributions = .*
